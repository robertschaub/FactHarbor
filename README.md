# FactHarbor

## What is FactHarbor?

FactHarbor is an AI-powered platform that turns complex, contested information into structured breakdowns that make reasoning visible and verifiable.

An Evidence Model contains:

- **Claims** — Key assertions extracted from the source material
- **Analysis Contexts** — The frames and conditions under which claims may hold or fail
- **Evidence** — Supporting and opposing sources with quality ratings and reliability scores
- **Verdicts** — Conclusions with explicit confidence levels and cited evidence
- **Full Transparency** — Every assumption, algorithm, and data source is exposed

The result is not a single verdict, but an **evidence landscape** — showing where a claim holds up, where it fails, and where reasonable disagreement exists.

**Who benefits?** Journalists, researchers, educators, policy analysts, and anyone navigating contested claims who wants to *understand*, not just believe.
