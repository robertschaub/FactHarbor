{{warning}}
**Archived 2026-02-19** — This content was extracted from the [[Pipeline Variants>>FactHarbor.Product Development.Specification.Architecture.Deep Dive.Pipeline Variants.WebHome]] page when the Orchestrated pipeline was removed in v2.11.0 (2026-02-17). The sections below describe the Orchestrated pipeline as it existed before removal. The ClaimAssessmentBoundary pipeline is now the default.

== Variant Comparison (Orchestrated Era) ==

This comparison table covered the two selectable variants when Orchestrated was the default:

|= Criterion |= Orchestrated |= Monolithic Dynamic
| **Maturity** | Production-ready (comprehensive) | Production-ready (fast alternative)
| **Result Schema** | Canonical (stable) | Dynamic (flexible)
| **UI Compatibility** | Full support | Separate viewer needed
| **Quality Gates** | Gate 1 + Gate 4 | Minimum safety contract
| **Pipeline Stages** | Fixed AKEL | LLM tool-loop
| **Provenance** | Strict | Minimum requirements
| **Budget Control** | Iterations / sources | maxSteps / sources
| **Cost Predictability** | High | Low
| **Typical Latency** | 2-5 min | 20-60s
| **Use Case** | Comprehensive analysis (default) | Fast analysis, second opinion

== Decision Tree (Orchestrated Era) ==

== Canonical Payload (Orchestrated) ==

Used by ##orchestrated##. Must match the entity model that the existing Jobs UI expects: claims, claim verdicts, article verdict, evidence items, sources.

== Configuration (Orchestrated Era Default) ==

=== Pipeline Selection (UCM) ===

{{code language="json"}}
{
  "defaultPipelineVariant": "orchestrated",
  "allowedVariants": [
    "orchestrated",
    "monolithic_dynamic"
  ]
}
{{/code}}

=== Per-Job Override (API) ===

{{code language="json"}}
POST /api/fh/jobs
{
  "inputType": "text",
  "inputValue": "...",
  "pipelineVariant": "orchestrated"
}
{{/code}}

== Performance Characteristics (Orchestrated Era) ==

Typical analysis time for a 5-10 claim article when Orchestrated was active:

|= Variant |= p50 |= p95 |= Est. Cost
| **Orchestrated** | 2-3 min | 5-7 min | $0.15-0.30
| **Monolithic Dynamic** | 1-2 min | 3-10 min | $0.10-0.50

== Navigation Reference (Orchestrated Era) ==
