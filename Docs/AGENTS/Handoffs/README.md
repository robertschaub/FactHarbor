# Agent Handoffs

Dedicated output files from significant agent tasks (multi-file changes, design decisions, investigations).

- **Naming:** `YYYY-MM-DD_<Role>_<Short_Description>.md`
- **Lifecycle:** Consumed by the next agent, then archived during Consolidate WIP.
- **Cross-reference:** Each file here should have a one-line pointer in `../Agent_Outputs.md`.

See AGENTS.md § Agent Exchange Protocol for the full template and rules.
