# Role Learnings Log

**Purpose:** Agents append learnings here during or after task completion. The Captain periodically reviews and promotes valuable entries into the Role Registry (`Multi_Agent_Collaboration_Rules.md` §2).

**Format:** Append new entries at the bottom of the relevant role section. Do NOT edit or delete existing entries — only the Captain curates this file.

## How to Contribute

After completing a task, if you discovered something that would help future agents in your role, append an entry:

```markdown
### {Date} — {Brief Title}
**Role:** {your role}  **Agent/Tool:** {e.g., Claude Code, Cursor, Cline}
**Category:** {tip | gotcha | missing-doc | wrong-assumption | useful-pattern | new-file}
**Learning:** {1-3 sentences: what you learned, why it matters, what to do differently}
**Files:** {relevant file paths, if any}
```

**Categories explained:**
- **tip**: Useful technique or shortcut for this role
- **gotcha**: Something that tripped you up or wasted time
- **missing-doc**: Documentation gap you had to work around
- **wrong-assumption**: An assumption from the role guidance that turned out to be incorrect
- **useful-pattern**: A code or workflow pattern worth reusing
- **new-file**: A new file was created that future agents should know about
