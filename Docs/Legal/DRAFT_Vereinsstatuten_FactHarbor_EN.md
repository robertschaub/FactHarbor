## Notes for Legal Review

> **IMPORTANT: This is a DRAFT prepared from the FactHarbor project documentation. It must be reviewed and adapted by a qualified Swiss legal advisor (Rechtsanwalt / Avocat) before adoption.**

Key points for legal counsel to review:

1. **Purpose clause (Art. 3)**: Confirm it is broad enough for tax-exempt status but specific enough for cantonal authorities. The purpose must be clearly "gemeinnützig" (public-benefit).

2. **Dissolution clause (Art. 26)**: Critical for tax-exempt status. Verify the "irrevocable dedication" language satisfies cantonal requirements.

3. **Non-profit constraint (Art. 4)**: Confirm this meets the "no profit distribution" test for Steuerbefreiung.

4. **Compensation provisions (Art. 18)**: Verify compatibility with tax-exempt status — some cantons are strict about any board compensation.

5. **Membership fees (Art. 7)**: Confirm symbolic fees do not create issues with cantonal tax authorities regarding genuine public-benefit character.

6. **Representation / Signing authority (Art. 17)**: Confirm the collective signature requirement is appropriate for the initial phase.

7. **Remote participation (Art. 11.4)**: Confirm this complies with current Swiss association law and practice.

8. **Handelsregister registration**: Advise whether voluntary registration is recommended at founding (for Goodstack/NPO verification purposes).

9. **Tax-exempt application**: Advise on the specific cantonal process and any additional documentation needed beyond these statutes.

10. **Asset Transfer Protocol**: If the founder has pre-existing assets (domains, code, trademarks), advise on documenting the transfer to the Verein.
