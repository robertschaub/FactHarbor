# V2 Current Lane Projection

**Last updated:** 2026-05-22
**Status:** advisory projection for active coordination, not a second approval source

This file mirrors the active V2 lane so agents do not need to reconstruct the
same state from chat, WIP packages, handoffs, status, backlog, and the live-job
ledger before every step. If this projection conflicts with an implementation
package, gate register, live-job ledger, or Captain instruction, the
authoritative source wins.

## Active Goal

Use the HighJump approach to get complete internal Pipeline V2 reports through
the normal manual submission path, now that V2 is the default pipeline and the
admin job UI can display V2 report markdown. Lower only report-blocking bars
that are shown by live evidence, then raise quality, safety, and completeness
from observed report defects.

## Current Implementation Anchor

Latest committed implementation anchor:

`3f1a1b4c fix(v2): rebalance evidence extraction material alignment`

The current working repair is HJ31: persist a bounded admin-only stop summary
through the existing admin reportMarkdown channel when the hidden V2 path does
not create an internal report draft. This is a diagnostic friction reduction,
not a new public route or product capability. It is needed because HJ30 showed
several shell-only runs where process-local hidden artifact routes were not
durable enough to explain the stop stage after runtime refresh.

Runtime has not yet been refreshed to the working HJ31 repair for the next
validation job. Commit before any live job.

## Latest Result

Latest validation:

`X7-HJ-30-MINI-GAUNTLET`

Result document:

`Docs/WIP/2026-05-22_V2_HighJump_HJ31_Admin_Stop_Summary_Diagnostics.md`

Important evidence:

- `6ce3a5827b464549b2c524d4f659ae7b` (Bolsonaro/fair-trial) ran default manual
  V2 on runtime `3f1a1b4c` and produced a hidden internal admin report
  (`5825` characters), but direct procedural-compliance/fair-trial evidence was
  still weak.
- `06e637107869409c9611b7c7984f1ff1` (hydrogen) produced a hidden internal
  admin report (`7000` characters) with FALSE / truth `15` / confidence `72`,
  inside the expected hydrogen-family band.
- `a0b131e0965e4a56afd485dc37344595` (German asylum aggregate),
  `0645495cce3d4c99bbb268bca7b1e3a2` (asylum/WW2 variant), and
  `2979fed360504100b689cbab8b265b7c` (plastic recycling) returned only the
  242-byte damaged shell. Hidden process-local artifact routes were unavailable
  after runtime refresh, so the exact stop stage was not durable.
- Public/default containment held for all HJ30 jobs: public V2 stayed
  `4.0.0-cb-precutover` / `blocked_precutover` / `report_damaged`, public and
  default job/page surfaces did not expose hidden report text or hidden statuses.

## Open Generalization Gap

The Bolsonaro input now reaches complete hidden/internal report generation
through the default manual V2 route:

- `315886278aa34b4a9ba8fd91d9ac3cc0`: W3-B later fetch failure;
- `d2aaaee251cd40bb9d6dd2291d235a76`: W4-A fetch diagnostic overstrictness;
- `34e0057f557a4e3f859702dbb1a45874`: W5 no extractable evidence;
- `4d9ff1dd1292405e8796937472774e51`: W5 no extractable evidence persisted
  after topic-neutral prompt lowering.
- `d2e18575dcbe453c9cbae2281438405e`: W5 no extractable evidence persisted
  after bounded search-preview material.
- `4a5ecd46675041eb9cdc347fc8bc2c94`: W3-B had Serper/OpenAlex/Wikimedia
  material, but W4-H blocked on `provider_id_mismatch`.
- `f84d914e9ae74259a9c58505d2da190d`: W4-H passed, W5 extracted `2`
  EvidenceItems, and the internal report writer produced `7381` report bytes.
- `327edd966a904108b8bc51f05ec64b42`: Serper distribution improved breadth and
  the internal report writer produced `10172` report bytes, but W5 admitted
  adjacent/generic material and the report remained `UNVERIFIED`.
- `323c5fd3540e43aab9c7c6e686ec4de4`: HJ29 material-alignment prompt repair
  removed adjacent/generic extraction, but W5 returned `no_extractable_evidence`
  despite 9 bounded source-content packets.
- `6ce3a5827b464549b2c524d4f659ae7b`: HJ30 material-alignment rebalance restored
  report creation, but report quality remains weak because direct
  procedural-compliance/fair-trial evidence is still thin.

The remaining question is no longer reachability for this input; it is report
quality and cross-input generalization. A compact report-quality review found
HJ27/HJ28/HJ30 materially below the Bolsonaro expectation (`LEANING-TRUE` /
`MOSTLY-TRUE`, truth `58..85`, confidence `45..75`, minimum `3` boundaries).
The active root cause is now mixed: W5 selectivity improved enough to create a
report again, but source-material usefulness and downstream extraction still do
not consistently surface direct fair-trial/procedural-compliance evidence.

## Live Budget

The machine ledger is `Docs/AGENTS/V2_Live_Job_Tranche_Ledger.json`.

Current active tranche:

- reset total: `18`;
- consumed after latest reset: `5`;
- remaining: `13`;
- every live job still requires clean git status, committed source, runtime
  refresh when needed, Web/API runtime commit match, and result documentation.

## Next Action

1. Commit HJ31 admin-only stop-summary diagnostics plus ledger/lane sync.
2. Refresh runtime to the HJ31 repair commit and verify API/Web commit match.
3. Rerun the HJ30 shell-only inputs first (`asylum-235000-de`, `plastic`, and
   optionally the asylum/WW2 variant) to capture durable stop summaries through
   admin reportMarkdown.
4. Use the first durable stop summary to decide the next HighJump repair:
   Source Material if records are missing, W5/source-material usefulness if
   material exists but EvidenceItems are zero, or downstream report handling if
   EvidenceItems exist but report writing stops.

## Stop Conditions

Stop and reconvene Steer-Co, or escalate to Captain only if needed, when:

- runtime commit does not match the committed source under test;
- the default manual submission path unexpectedly runs V1;
- route/default-admin/public/log/error surfaces leak report text, source text,
  prompt text, provider payload, hidden ids, or public verdict/truth/confidence;
- the next repair would require retries, schema relaxation, a parallel report
  path, source/provider expansion, public behavior, V1 cleanup, parser/cache/SR
  storage, ACS/direct URL, or another hidden mechanism;
- a standing Captain approval gate is reached or team consent fails on a
  material decision.

Do not stop for routine implementation mechanics inside the current
HighJump/report-quality path.
