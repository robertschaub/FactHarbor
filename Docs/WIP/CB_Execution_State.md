## Handover Log

Each agent writes a short entry here when completing a session.

| Date | Agent/Role | Phase | Summary | Files Touched | Issues Found |
|------|-----------|-------|---------|---------------|-------------|
| 2026-02-16 | Lead Architect | Planning | Architecture doc complete. All 10 open questions resolved. Migration strategy with incremental cleanup, commit/tag plan, agent team plan, confusion prevention rules. | `Docs/WIP/ClaimBoundary_Pipeline_Architecture_2026-02-15.md` | None |
| 2026-02-16 | Lead Architect | Step 0 | Governance docs updated for CB pipeline. AGENTS.md: added ClaimBoundary/AtomicClaim to terminology, added new pipeline files to Key Files, marked orchestrated.ts as BEING REPLACED. CLAUDE.md: updated data flow + key files. Multi_Agent_Collaboration_Rules.md: added CB arch doc to Pipeline area mapping + reading lists for Lead Architect, Lead Developer, Senior Developer, LLM Expert. xWiki Terminology: added migration warning, annotated AC section as "being replaced", added section 1b for ClaimBoundary terminology. | `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `Docs/AGENTS/Multi_Agent_Collaboration_Rules.md`, `Docs/xwiki-pages/.../Terminology/WebHome.xwiki`, `Docs/WIP/CB_Execution_State.md` | None |
| 2026-02-16 | Senior Developer | Phase 1a | CB types added to types.ts (AtomicClaim, ClaimBoundary, BoundaryFinding, CBClaimVerdict, CoverageMatrix, VerdictNarrative, + supporting types). Pipeline skeleton created with 5 stage functions + main entry point. Coverage matrix fully implemented (deterministic). Test file with 24+ tests (type validity, coverage matrix, stage existence). Build + tests pass (48 files, 873 tests). | `apps/web/src/lib/analyzer/types.ts`, `apps/web/src/lib/analyzer/claimboundary-pipeline.ts`, `apps/web/test/unit/lib/analyzer/claimboundary-pipeline.test.ts`, `Docs/WIP/CB_Execution_State.md` | None |
| 2026-02-16 | Senior Developer | Phase 1b | Verdict-stage module created with all 5 steps as independently testable functions. Injectable LLM call abstraction for testability. Spread multiplier calculations per §8.5.5 with UCM-configurable thresholds. Structural consistency check (deterministic invariants). Wired into pipeline Stage 4 via `runVerdictStage()`. 29 new tests with mocked LLM calls covering all steps + spread multipliers + full orchestration. Build + tests pass (49 files, 902 tests). | `apps/web/src/lib/analyzer/verdict-stage.ts`, `apps/web/src/lib/analyzer/claimboundary-pipeline.ts`, `apps/web/test/unit/lib/analyzer/verdict-stage.test.ts`, `Docs/WIP/CB_Execution_State.md` | None |
| 2026-02-16 | LLM Expert | Phase 1c | All 8 pipeline prompts created in `prompts/claimboundary.prompt.md`: CLAIM_EXTRACTION_PASS1 (Haiku), CLAIM_EXTRACTION_PASS2 (Sonnet), BOUNDARY_CLUSTERING (Sonnet), VERDICT_ADVOCATE (Sonnet), VERDICT_CHALLENGER (Sonnet), VERDICT_RECONCILIATION (Sonnet), VERDICT_NARRATIVE (Sonnet), CLAIM_GROUPING (Haiku). UCM-managed from day one: registered "claimboundary" profile in VALID_PROMPT_PROFILES (config-storage.ts) and valid pipelines list (config-schemas.ts). All prompts follow AGENTS.md rules: no English assumptions, no hardcoded keywords, generic examples, no test-case terms. Congruence examples from §11.5 included in BOUNDARY_CLUSTERING (genericized). Build + tests pass (49 files, 902 tests). Prompt seeded on build. | `apps/web/prompts/claimboundary.prompt.md`, `apps/web/src/lib/config-storage.ts`, `apps/web/src/lib/config-schemas.ts`, `Docs/WIP/CB_Execution_State.md` | None |
| 2026-02-16 | Senior Developer | Phase 1 Review Fixes | Fixed all 3 blocking + 1 non-blocking review issues. **F-03:** `stable` in selfConsistencyCheck now uses `stableThreshold` (5pp) instead of `moderateThreshold` (12pp). **F-04:** `mixedConfidenceThreshold` from VerdictStageConfig (default 40) now threaded through to all 3 `percentageToClaimVerdict()` call sites via config parameter on `advocateVerdict`, `reconcileVerdicts`, and `runStructuralConsistencyCheck`. **F-01:** Added VERDICT_GROUNDING_VALIDATION and VERDICT_DIRECTION_VALIDATION prompt sections to claimboundary.prompt.md + requiredSections. **F-02:** Added "claimboundary" to `PromptFrontmatterSchema` z.enum in config-schemas.ts. Build + tests pass (49 files, 902 tests). | `apps/web/src/lib/analyzer/verdict-stage.ts`, `apps/web/prompts/claimboundary.prompt.md`, `apps/web/src/lib/config-schemas.ts`, `apps/web/test/unit/lib/analyzer/verdict-stage.test.ts`, `Docs/WIP/CB_Execution_State.md` | F-05 deferred (aggregation gaps for Stage 5) |
| 2026-02-16 | Code Reviewer | Phase 1 Review | **APPROVE WITH CONDITIONS.** 50 tests reviewed (21 pipeline + 29 verdict-stage). Types match §9.1. Terminology clean (no AC/contextId). No forbidden imports. 8 prompts AGENTS.md-compliant (no hardcoded keywords, multilingual, generic examples). Spread multiplier matches §8.5.5. **3 blocking issues:** F-01: VERDICT_GROUNDING_VALIDATION and VERDICT_DIRECTION_VALIDATION prompt sections missing from claimboundary.prompt.md (verdict-stage.ts lines 424, 435 reference them). F-03: `stable` field in selfConsistencyCheck uses `moderateThreshold` (12pp) instead of `stableThreshold` (5pp) — line 305. F-04: `mixedConfidenceThreshold` from VerdictStageConfig (40) never passed to `percentageToClaimVerdict()` — 3 call sites fall back to truth-scale.ts default of 60, mismatching §8.5.5 spec (40). **2 non-blocking:** F-02: `PromptFrontmatterSchema` z.enum missing "claimboundary" (config-schemas.ts line 1122). F-05: aggregation.ts missing triangulationFactor/derivativeFactor and harm multipliers don't match §8.5.4 4-level spec — to be fixed when Stage 5 is implemented. | (read-only review) | F-01, F-02, F-03, F-04, F-05 |
| 2026-02-16 | Senior Developer | Phase 2: Route Wiring | **ClaimBoundary pipeline wired as default route.** Added "claimboundary" to PipelineVariant type, updated internal-runner-queue to call `runClaimBoundaryAnalysis` as default (orchestrated becomes fallback). Added `jobId?` to AnalysisInput type (used by all pipelines for debug logging). Updated CB pipeline return type to `{resultJson, reportMarkdown}` structure matching orchestrated schema. Defined new resultJson schema (version 3.0.0-cb) with claimBoundaries/claimVerdicts/coverageMatrix, no AnalysisContext references. Fallback changed: Monolithic Dynamic now falls back to ClaimBoundary (not orchestrated). Build PASS. ClaimBoundary tests PASS (24), Aggregation tests PASS (13). (Note: `npm test` runner fails with "No test suite found" for all files when run together — pre-existing vitest/Windows path issue confirmed on previous commit; individual test files pass successfully.) | `apps/web/src/lib/internal-runner-queue.ts`, `apps/web/src/lib/analyzer/claimboundary-pipeline.ts`, `apps/web/src/lib/analyzer/types.ts`, `Docs/WIP/CB_Execution_State.md` | None |
| 2026-02-16 | Senior Developer | Phase 2a: Delete orchestrated | **Orchestrated pipeline completely removed in 4 commits (~18,400 lines deleted).** Step 1: Deleted orchestrated.ts (13600 lines), analysis-contexts.ts (564 lines), evidence-context-utils.ts (86 lines), + 4 AC test files. Fixed imports in analyzer.ts, index.ts, internal-runner-queue.ts. Step 2: Deleted orchestrated prompt files (orchestrated.prompt.md 62KB, orchestrated-compact.prompt.md 9KB, + 3 base prompt files 33KB). Removed orchestrated task types from prompt-builder.ts, removed "orchestrated" from VALID_PROMPT_PROFILES. Step 3: Removed 14 AC config fields from config-schemas.ts (contextDedupThreshold, contextDetection*, contextPrompt*, evidenceScope*, contextNameAlignment*), removed contextDedupThreshold accessor from analyzer/config.ts, removed AC validation warning, removed UI form group. Step 4: Deleted context-preservation.test.ts (19KB) and adversarial-context-leak.test.ts (17KB). Made confidence-calibration contextAnswers parameter optional, removed 7 AC tests from confidence-calibration.test.ts (52 tests remain). All builds + individual tests PASS at each commit. | 11 files deleted, 8 files modified, ~18,400 lines removed | None |
| 2026-02-16 | Lead Architect | Phase 3-4 Planning | Full codebase audit of remaining AC references: 20 files, ~159 refs. Key finding: monolithic-dynamic.ts has ZERO AC refs — it uses prompt-loader (not prompt-builder base prompts). The 5 base prompt files (53 AC refs) and 3 provider adapters (51 AC refs) are likely dead code after orchestrated.ts deletion. Wrote detailed prompts for Phase 3 (UI), Phase 3b (MD prompt cleanup — Approach A: delete dead prompt code), Phase 4 (final sweep + verification). Updated CB_Execution_State to mark 2b/2c as complete (folded into 2a). Updated CB_Phase_Prompts.md with full prompts for all remaining phases. | `Docs/WIP/CB_Phase_Prompts.md`, `Docs/WIP/CB_Execution_State.md` | None |
| 2026-02-16 | Technical Writer | Phase 2 Docs | **Phase 2 documentation complete on worktree.** Rewrote 5 xWiki pages from AnalysisContext to ClaimBoundary: Terminology (v4.0.0-cb), Scope Definition Guidelines (v3.0.0-cb), Context Detection → Boundary Clustering, Decision Tree → Boundary Clustering Decision Flow, Phases → ClaimBoundary Pipeline Stages. Metrics: 183 AC refs → 44 (76% reduction), 1,931 lines total. Updated Current_Status.md (marked Phase 1/2/2a/2 docs complete) and Backlog.md (moved 5 items to Recently Completed). All changes comply with AGENTS.md generic examples policy. Committed to worktree (d2d4463). Ready for Captain to merge worktree to main. | Worktree: 5 xWiki pages, `Current_Status.md`, `Backlog.md`; Main: `CB_Execution_State.md` | None |
| 2026-02-16 | Senior Developer | Phase 3: UI | **Phase 3 UI update complete in 3 steps.** Step 1: Created BoundaryFindings.tsx component (175 lines) with inline boundary display, direction icons (✓/✗/⚖), compact metadata (evidence count + temporal), hover tooltips, suppression when ≤2 boundaries per §18 Q10. Step 2: Updated page.tsx for CB schema — added isCBSchema detection, extracted claimBoundaries, updated ClaimCard to render boundaryFindings, updated badges (BOUNDARIES vs CONTEXTS), passed claimBoundaries to all ClaimCard instances. Step 3: Deleted ClaimsGroupedByContext.tsx (154 lines), removed import + context-grouping logic, simplified to flat claim list. Clean break per §15.1 — no backward compatibility. All builds PASS at each step. 3 commits: a3a6aae (BoundaryFindings), f139c39 (page.tsx), b7bc64a (cleanup). | `apps/web/src/app/jobs/[id]/components/BoundaryFindings.tsx`, `apps/web/src/app/jobs/[id]/page.tsx`, `apps/web/src/app/jobs/[id]/page.module.css`, deleted `ClaimsGroupedByContext.tsx`, `Docs/WIP/CB_Execution_State.md` | None |
| 2026-02-16 | Senior Developer | Phase 3b: Monolithic Dynamic Cleanup | **Phase 3b complete in 5 steps (~3300 lines deleted).** Step 1: Dead code verification — confirmed 5 base prompt files (59 AC refs) + 4 provider adapters (52 AC refs + 4 context_refinement functions) + 3 config-adaptation files only used by deleted buildPrompt(). Step 2: Deleted 5 base prompt files, gutted prompt-builder.ts (kept detectProvider/isBudgetModel utilities), deleted prompt-testing.ts + 3 test files testing dead code (2016 lines removed). Step 3: Deleted 4 provider adapter files, 2 config-adaptation files, cleaned structured-output.ts AC refs (CTX_XXX→CB_XXX, contextId→claimId, removed context_refinement) (1021 lines removed). Step 4: Updated monolithic-dynamic.prompt.md — AnalysisContext→ClaimBoundary (4 refs), Multi-Context→Multi-Boundary, CTX_XXX→CB_XXX. Step 5: Updated monolithic-dynamic-prompt.test.ts for CB terminology. Deleted OUTPUT_SCHEMAS.md (264 lines, legacy orchestrated schemas). **Verification:** `grep "AnalysisContext" src/lib/analyzer/prompts/` returns ZERO hits. All builds PASS, 724/724 tests PASS (88 fewer tests — removed dead code tests). 6 commits: c7c0e16 (base prompts), ab397f4 (providers), 0f4088f (MD prompt), 059bcd2 (tests), a5aa9c1 (schemas). | Deleted: 5 base prompts, 4 providers, 3 config-adaptations, prompt-testing.ts, 3 test files, OUTPUT_SCHEMAS.md; Updated: prompt-builder.ts, structured-output.ts, monolithic-dynamic.prompt.md, monolithic-dynamic-prompt.test.ts, CB_Execution_State.md | None |
| 2026-02-16 | Senior Developer | Phase 4: Final Sweep | **Phase 4 complete in 4 steps. MIGRATION COMPLETE.** Step 0: Audit found 67 AC refs across 13 files (35 AnalysisContext + 21 contextId + 11 analysisContexts). Step 1: Deleted 4 AC type definitions from types.ts (AnalysisContext, ContextVerdict, EnrichedAnalysisContext, AnalysisContextAnswer), removed contextId fields from EvidenceItem/ClaimVerdict/ClaimUnderstanding/ResearchDecision, removed analysisContexts from ClaimUnderstanding/ArticleAnalysis, removed AC exports from index.ts, deleted checkContextConfidenceConsistency() from confidence-calibration.ts, cleaned evidence-recency.ts + quality-gates.ts. Step 2: Cleaned utility modules — removed BudgetTracker.iterationsByContext + checkContextIterationBudget() + recordIteration() from budgets.ts, removed contextId from evidence-normalization.ts, simplified claim-importance.ts (global grouping only), removed analysisContexts from metrics-integration.ts. Step 3: Updated remaining references — added LEGACY comment to page.tsx analysisContexts fallback, updated tooltip (removed "AnalysisContext"), marked config fields as DEPRECATED (llmContextSimilarity, maxIterationsPerContext), updated config.ts comments. Step 4: Updated governance docs — removed AnalysisContext from AGENTS.md terminology table, updated CLAUDE.md migration note to "Migration complete (2026-02-16)". **Verification:** Zero active AC code remains (grep clean except documentation/comments). All builds PASS. All tests PASS (716/724, 8 skipped budget tests using deleted functions). 5 commits: cf39c04 (types), d700665 (utilities), 3030d97 (comments), 41b66b7 (governance), [this]. | types.ts, index.ts, confidence-calibration.ts, evidence-recency.ts, quality-gates.ts, budgets.ts, evidence-normalization.ts, claim-importance.ts, metrics-integration.ts, page.tsx, config-schemas.ts, config.ts, AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, budgets.test.ts, CB_Execution_State.md | None |
| 2026-02-16 | Code Reviewer | Final Verification | **PASS — Migration functionally complete.** Build PASS, 716/724 tests PASS (8 skipped budget tests). `grep AnalysisContext` in src/: 16 hits, ALL comments/docs — zero active code. `grep contextId`: 3 LEGACY UI hits (page.tsx backward-compat, labeled), 1 optional debug field (types.ts:652 AnalysisWarning.details). `grep analysisContexts`: 1 LEGACY hit (page.tsx:339, labeled). **9 non-blocking findings:** V-01: `contextId?` in AnalysisWarning.details (vestigial). V-02: LEGACY page.tsx code for old schemas (acceptable). V-03: AGENTS.md still lists `orchestrated.ts` in architecture diagram (line 109) and Key Files (line 121); CB files still tagged `[NEW]`. V-04: CLAUDE.md line 9 still lists `orchestrated.ts [BEING REPLACED]`. V-05: AGENTS.md lines 149-150, 161-162 reference deleted test:contexts/test:adversarial scripts and files. V-06: CLAUDE.md line 41 references same deleted test scripts. V-07: AGENTS.md line 63 mentions AnalysisContexts (minor, parenthetical). V-08: package.json:18-19 has test:contexts/test:adversarial scripts pointing to deleted files. V-09: 8 skipped budget tests use deleted functions. **No blocking issues. Migration complete.** | (read-only review) | V-01 through V-09 (all non-blocking) |
| 2026-02-17 | Lead Architect | UCM Config | **UCM configuration complete for ClaimBoundary pipeline.** Audit report: `Docs/WIP/UCM_Configuration_Audit_2026-02-17.md`. Added all 24 CB parameters from architecture doc §13.1 to UCM schemas: PipelineConfigSchema (Stage 1-4: centralityThreshold, claimSpecificityMinimum, maxAtomicClaims, preliminarySearchQueriesPerClaim, preliminaryMaxSources, gate1GroundingRetryThreshold, claimSufficiencyThreshold, contradictionReservedIterations, maxClaimBoundaries, boundaryCoherenceMinimum, selfConsistencyMode, selfConsistencyTemperature), CalcConfigSchema (Stage 4-5: selfConsistencySpreadThresholds, harmPotentialMultipliers [4-level replacing scalar], triangulation, derivativeMultiplier). Fixed SearchConfigSchema (added tavily/brave to provider enum, added searchRelevanceMode). Updated transform blocks with defaults. Updated pipeline.default.json + calculation.default.json with CB defaults. Build PASS (21 workers, 23 static pages). Tests PASS (716/724, 8 skipped). Prompt seeding verified: all 7 profiles exist on disk, all registered in UCM. One orphaned file found (text-analysis-counter-claim.prompt.md — NOT registered). MD config verified complete. | `apps/web/src/lib/config-schemas.ts`, `apps/web/configs/pipeline.default.json`, `apps/web/configs/calculation.default.json`, `Docs/WIP/UCM_Configuration_Audit_2026-02-17.md`, `Docs/WIP/CB_Execution_State.md` | One orphaned prompt file: `text-analysis-counter-claim.prompt.md` (not registered in VALID_PROMPT_PROFILES) |
| 2026-02-17 | Lead Architect | Review Fixes Round 3 | **Codex GPT 5.2 re-review #3 fixes complete (4 blocking + 1 suggestion).** B-01: Removed hardcoded "counterevidence/critique" phrasing (line 173), replaced with "Use UCM GENERATE_QUERIES with iterationType: contradiction". B-02: Removed hardcoded contestationFactor (0.85) from Stage 5 weight snippet — CBClaimVerdict lacks factualBasis field for 3-level contestationWeights mapping. B-03: Replaced all unicode × with * in code blocks (6 instances: 2 in prompts doc, 4 in plan doc). B-04: Rewrote Stage 5 weight calculation snippet to match actual CB types — now uses supportingEvidenceIds to look up evidence from state, accesses CalcConfig multipliers directly (centralityWeights, harmPotentialMultipliers), includes full derivative formula with proper evidence filtering. S-01: Test bullets already correct (line 325 says "verify spread multipliers NOT re-applied"). Build PASS (21 workers, 23 static pages), 0 config changes, 0 prompt changes. Ready for Phase 5a implementation. | `Docs/WIP/CB_Implementation_Prompts.md`, `Docs/WIP/CB_Implementation_Plan_2026-02-17.md`, `Docs/WIP/CB_Execution_State.md` | None |
| 2026-02-17 | Lead Architect | Review Fixes Round 4 | **Codex GPT 5.2 re-review #4 fixes complete (3 blocking + 1 suggestion).** B-01: Deleted redundant Step 2 (derivativeRatio snippet with incorrect `claim.supportingEvidence` reference), renumbered remaining steps 3→2 through 8→7. Correct implementation already existed in Step 3. B-02: Updated architecture §8.5.4 to explicitly defer contestation weighting to v1.1 — v1.0 formula now documented as `centrality × harm × confidence × triangulation × derivative` (no contestation). Added section explaining CBClaimVerdict lacks factualBasis field, getClaimWeight() incompatibility, v1.1 implementation options. B-03: Replaced "Reuse getClaimWeight()" instruction with "Compute weight directly using CalcConfig multipliers" + note that getClaimWeight() expects legacy fields not in CBClaimVerdict. S-01: Updated test bullet from "Test confidence aggregation with spread multipliers" to "verify spread multipliers are NOT re-applied in Stage 5". Build PASS. Plan ✅ prompts ✅ architecture ✅ now fully aligned. | `Docs/WIP/CB_Implementation_Prompts.md`, `Docs/WIP/CB_Implementation_Plan_2026-02-17.md`, `Docs/WIP/ClaimBoundary_Pipeline_Architecture_2026-02-15.md`, `Docs/WIP/CB_Codex_Review_Fixes_4_2026-02-17.md`, `Docs/WIP/CB_Execution_State.md` | None |
| 2026-02-17 | Lead Architect | Review Fixes Round 5 | **Codex GPT 5.2 re-review #5 fixes complete (1 blocking + 1 suggestion).** B-01: Replaced incompatible `calculateWeightedVerdictAverage()` call with inline weighted average math (`Σ(value × weight) / Σ(weight)`). Function expects legacy ClaimVerdict objects and recomputes weights via getClaimWeight(), incompatible with CB's direct CalcConfig approach. Now computes both `weightedTruthPercentage` and `weightedConfidence` inline using same precomputed weights. S-01: Explicitly compute truth% and confidence using identical weights (prevents divergence). Changed `weightsPerClaim` → `weightsData` to include both values in same object. Removed import of calculateWeightedVerdictAverage. Added note: "Do NOT use aggregation.ts helpers — both expect legacy type shapes". Build PASS. Implementation snippets now match actual function signatures. | `Docs/WIP/CB_Implementation_Prompts.md`, `Docs/WIP/CB_Implementation_Plan_2026-02-17.md`, `Docs/WIP/CB_Codex_Review_Fixes_5_2026-02-17.md`, `Docs/WIP/CB_Execution_State.md` | None |
| 2026-02-17 | Senior Developer | Phase 5b: Stage 2 | **Stage 2 (researchEvidence) fully implemented.** Claim-driven iteration loop: seed evidence from Stage 1 preliminary search, target claim with fewest evidence items, LLM query generation (GENERATE_QUERIES UCM prompt), web search + batched LLM relevance classification (RELEVANCE_CLASSIFICATION UCM prompt), source fetch + reliability prefetch, evidence extraction with mandatory EvidenceScope (EXTRACT_EVIDENCE UCM prompt), scope quality assessment (complete/partial/incomplete), derivative validation (§8.2 step 9), deterministic evidence filter, sufficiency check with early exit. Contradiction search (reserved iterations) targeting claims with fewest contradicting evidence. Added CB-specific fields to EvidenceItem type: sourceType, relevantClaimIds, claimBoundaryId, isDerivative, derivedFromSourceUrl, derivativeClaimUnverified, scopeQuality. Added additionalDimensions to EvidenceScope (D4). All sub-functions exported for testing: seedEvidenceFromPreliminarySearch, findLeastResearchedClaim, findLeastContradictedClaim, allClaimsSufficient, assessScopeQuality, generateResearchQueries, classifyRelevance, extractResearchEvidence, fetchSources, runResearchIteration. 28 new tests. Build PASS, 42 files 768 tests PASS. | `apps/web/src/lib/analyzer/claimboundary-pipeline.ts`, `apps/web/src/lib/analyzer/types.ts`, `apps/web/test/unit/lib/analyzer/claimboundary-pipeline.test.ts`, `Docs/WIP/CB_Execution_State.md` | None |
| 2026-02-17 | Senior Developer | Phase 5a: Stage 1 | **Stage 1 (extractClaims) fully implemented.** Two-pass evidence-grounded claim extraction: Pass 1 (Haiku rapid scan → roughClaims + searchHint), Preliminary Search (web search + source fetch + batched evidence extraction), Pass 2 (Sonnet evidence-grounded atomic claim extraction with full AtomicClaim schema), Centrality Filter (deterministic, sorts high-first, caps at maxAtomicClaims), Gate 1 Validation (batched Haiku, opinion + specificity checks, overallPass). All sub-functions exported for unit testing: runPass1, runPass2, runGate1Validation, runPreliminarySearch, generateSearchQueries, filterByCentrality, detectInputType. Added "claimboundary" to Pipeline type in prompt-loader.ts. Zod schemas for all LLM output parsing (Pass1, Pass2, Gate1, ExtractEvidence). 24 new tests with vi.mock for ai, llm, prompt-loader, config-loader, web-search, retrieval modules. Build PASS, 42 files 740 tests PASS. | `apps/web/src/lib/analyzer/claimboundary-pipeline.ts`, `apps/web/src/lib/analyzer/prompt-loader.ts`, `apps/web/test/unit/lib/analyzer/claimboundary-pipeline.test.ts`, `Docs/WIP/CB_Execution_State.md` | None |
| 2026-02-17 | Lead Architect | Final Housekeeping | **Implementation plan APPROVED — ready for Phase 5a execution.** Codex GPT 5.2 final review: APPROVE verdict (0 blocking, 0 suggestions). Applied Lead Developer requested updates: (1) Added deferred item #6: contestation weight reduction — CB debate pattern already adjusts for counter-evidence, separate multiplier from legacy getClaimWeight() deferred to v1.1 (requires factualBasis field or binary penalty). (2) Updated Plan footer v1.0→v1.1: changed "Next Step" to "Prompts document created", updated Captain Decision Points with APPROVED status, changed Status to "APPROVED — Ready for Phase 5a execution". (3) Added test count targets to Prompts Testing sections (Phases 5a, 5d). (4) Added Phase 5j note to Prompts (verification-only, no code changes needed, MD already CB-compatible). Build PASS. Total review effort: 6 rounds, 35 blocking issues + 9 suggestions = 44 improvements. Both documents approved and production-ready. | `Docs/WIP/CB_Implementation_Plan_2026-02-17.md`, `Docs/WIP/CB_Implementation_Prompts.md`, `Docs/WIP/CB_Execution_State.md` | None |
| 2026-02-17 | Senior Developer | Phase 5d: Stage 4 Wiring | **Stage 4 LLM wiring fully implemented.** `createProductionLLMCall()`: loads UCM prompt sections via `loadAndRenderSection("claimboundary", promptKey, ...)`, selects model via `getModelForTask()` based on tier ("sonnet"→"verdict", "haiku"→"understand"), calls AI SDK `generateText()` with system+user messages, parses JSON response with markdown code block fallback extraction. `buildVerdictStageConfig()`: maps UCM PipelineConfig (selfConsistencyMode, selfConsistencyTemperature) + CalcConfig (selfConsistencySpreadThresholds, mixedConfidenceThreshold) to VerdictStageConfig structure. `generateVerdicts()` wired: loads both pipeline and calc configs, builds VerdictStageConfig, creates production LLM call if none injected (backward compatible with test injection), passes config to `runVerdictStage()`. Added imports: `loadCalcConfig`, `CalcConfig`, `VerdictStageConfig`, `DEFAULT_VERDICT_STAGE_CONFIG`. 11 new tests: buildVerdictStageConfig (3), createProductionLLMCall (6), generateVerdicts wiring (2). Build PASS, 42 files 800 tests PASS. | `apps/web/src/lib/analyzer/claimboundary-pipeline.ts`, `apps/web/test/unit/lib/analyzer/claimboundary-pipeline.test.ts`, `Docs/WIP/CB_Execution_State.md` | None |
| 2026-02-17 | Senior Developer | Phase 5c: Stage 3 | **Stage 3 (clusterBoundaries) fully implemented.** EvidenceScope deduplication via fingerprinting (methodology+temporal+geographic+boundaries, case/trim-insensitive). LLM clustering via BOUNDARY_CLUSTERING UCM prompt (Sonnet tier): receives unique scopes, evidence items with scope assignments, atomic claims for context; returns ClaimBoundary[] with constituent scopes, coherence scores, congruence rationale. Coherence assessment: flags boundaries below boundaryCoherenceMinimum (UCM, default 0.3) — warn only in v1. Post-clustering validation (deterministic): empty/malformed boundary filtering, duplicate ID resolution, completeness check (every scope in exactly one boundary), orphan scope recovery (adds to "General" fallback), cap enforcement via Jaccard similarity merge (mergeClosestBoundaries). Evidence item assignment: fingerprint-based scope→boundary mapping, fallback to General boundary for unmatched items. All sub-functions exported for testing: scopeFingerprint, collectUniqueScopes, runLLMClustering, createFallbackBoundary, assignEvidenceToBoundaries, boundaryJaccardSimilarity, mergeClosestBoundaries. 21 new tests.

| 2026-02-17 | Senior Developer | Phase 5e: Stage 5 | **Stage 5 (aggregateAssessment) fully implemented.** Triangulation scoring per claim (§8.5.2): counts supporting/contradicting boundary findings, classifies as strong (≥3 supporting, +0.15), moderate (2 supporting, +0.05), weak (single boundary, -0.10), or conflicted (evenly split, 0). Derivative weight reduction (§8.5.3): `1.0 - (derivativeRatio × (1.0 - derivativeMultiplier))`, only counts verified derivatives (isDerivative=true AND derivativeClaimUnverified≠true). Weighted average (§8.5.4): `centrality × harm × confidence × (1 + triangulation) × derivative`, inline computation (NOT using aggregation.ts helpers — incompatible legacy types). 7-point verdict via `percentageToArticleVerdict()` with UCM mixedConfidenceThreshold. VerdictNarrative (§8.5.6): Sonnet LLM call via VERDICT_NARRATIVE UCM prompt with Zod structured output (headline, evidenceBaseSummary, keyFinding, boundaryDisagreements?, limitations); fallback narrative on LLM failure. Quality gates (§8.5.7): maps CB gate1Stats to Gate1Stats shape (totalClaims→total, passedSpecificity→passed), computes Gate4Stats confidence breakdown (high≥70, medium≥40, low>0, insufficient=0). All helpers exported for testing: `computeTriangulationScore`, `computeDerivativeFactor`, `generateVerdictNarrative`, `buildQualityGates`. 17 new tests: triangulation (4: strong/moderate/weak/conflicted), derivative factor (4: empty/no-derivative/all-derivative/unverified), narrative (2: success/with-disagreements), quality gates (4: gate1-mapping/gate4-breakdown/failed-gate1/summary-stats), integration (3: full-assessment/fallback-narrative/multi-boundary).

| 2026-02-17 | Code Reviewer | Phase 5f: Integration Test | **End-to-end integration test file created.** 3 test scenarios with full schema validation: (1) Simple input — single verifiable fact ("Eiffel Tower in Paris"), validates TRUE/MOSTLY-TRUE, ≥1 boundary, ≥1 evidence item. (2) Multi-claim — 3 economic statistics (GDP, unemployment, inflation), validates ≥2 claims, per-claim verdicts, coverage matrix rows. (3) Adversarial — opinion+fact mix ("Electric cars future" + "Tesla sales"), validates Gate 1 opinion handling, evidence for factual claims. Schema helpers: `assertCBSchema` (3.0.0-cb version, core fields, no AC references), `assertClaimVerdictConsistency` (claim-verdict FK integrity), `assertCoverageMatrix` (dimensions match claims×boundaries), `assertBoundaryStructure` (CB_XX IDs, required fields). All tests use `test.skip()` by default (real LLM calls, ~$0.50-1.00/test). Added to vitest exclude list. Created `test:cb-integration` npm script. Build PASS, 42 files 817 tests PASS (integration test correctly excluded). | `apps/web/test/integration/claimboundary-integration.test.ts` (NEW), `apps/web/vitest.config.ts`, `apps/web/package.json`, `Docs/WIP/CB_Execution_State.md` | None |
| 2026-02-17 | Lead Architect | Rename Strategy (Refined + Timing Fix) | **ClaimBoundary → ClaimAssessmentBoundary rename timing and scope decided.** **Initial proposal:** ClaimAssessmentScope (full rename). **Codex cautions:** (1) AGENTS.md says ClaimBoundary "NEVER call it scope" — renaming to ClaimAssessmentScope violates governance, requires AGENTS.md rule changes. (2) UCM/config blast radius — renaming prompt profile, pipeline variant, schema version = DB migration + seeding changes + UI detection updates (2-3 sessions, HIGH risk). **Captain's solution:** Rename to **ClaimAssessmentBoundary** instead → keeps "Boundary" terminology (no governance conflict), allows partial rename (types/docs only, internals unchanged). **Lead Architect recommendation: Partial rename (Option B).** What changes: Types (CBClaimBoundary→CBClaimAssessmentBoundary, ClaimBoundary→ClaimAssessmentBoundary), variables (claimBoundary→claimAssessmentBoundary or assessmentBoundary), UI labels ("Claim Boundaries"→"Claim Assessment Boundaries"), docs (architecture/plan/prompts), governance (add ClaimAssessmentBoundary to AGENTS.md terminology table). What stays: prompt profile ("claimboundary"), file name (claimboundary.prompt.md), pipeline variant ("claimboundary"), schema version ("3.0.0-cb"), config keys. **Timing (UPDATED 2026-02-17):** After Phase 5f (implementation complete), **BEFORE Phase 5g (documentation)** to avoid double documentation work. Now designated **Phase 5f2**. **Effort:** ~1 session (find/replace + governance updates), low risk, zero UCM/config changes. **Captain approved.** Execution: pause after Phase 5f integration test, execute rename checklist (see detailed checklist in this document), commit as `refactor: rename ClaimBoundary → ClaimAssessmentBoundary (partial)`, run full test suite, then proceed to Phase 5g which will document the final terminology. | `Docs/WIP/CB_Execution_State.md`, `Docs/WIP/CB_Implementation_Plan_2026-02-17.md` | None |
| 2026-02-17 | Lead Architect | Phase 5f2: Rename Execution | **Phase 5f2 COMPLETE — ClaimBoundary → ClaimAssessmentBoundary rename executed.** Systematic partial rename following 10-step checklist. Step 1: Types updated (types.ts: ClaimBoundary→ClaimAssessmentBoundary, all type annotations, comments). Step 2: Implementation code (claimboundary-pipeline.ts, verdict-stage.ts: type refs, comments; kept runClaimBoundaryAnalysis function name per checklist). Step 3: Test files (3 files: type annotations, comments, architecture refs). Step 4: UI components (BoundaryFindings.tsx local type, page.tsx comments). Step 5: Documentation (Architecture, Plan, Prompts, Execution State: all "ClaimBoundary Pipeline" → "ClaimAssessmentBoundary Pipeline", architecture file refs updated, Confusion Prevention section updated). Step 6: Governance (AGENTS.md terminology table, CLAUDE.md terminology, Multi_Agent_Collaboration_Rules.md area mapping). Step 8: Verification (build PASS, 817/825 tests PASS, 8 skipped budget tests expected). Step 9: Commit c87a67d (18 files changed, 531 insertions, 155 deletions). **Internal IDs unchanged:** prompt profile "claimboundary", pipeline variant "claimboundary", schema "3.0.0-cb", function name runClaimBoundaryAnalysis, file claimboundary.prompt.md. **Zero UCM/config migration required.** Ready for Phase 5g (documentation updates will use new ClaimAssessmentBoundary terminology). | 18 files: types.ts, claimboundary-pipeline.ts, verdict-stage.ts, internal-runner-queue.ts, 3 test files, BoundaryFindings.tsx, page.tsx, 4 doc files (Architecture, Plan, Prompts, Execution State), 3 governance files (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, Multi_Agent_Collaboration_Rules.md), CB_Execution_State.md | None |
| 2026-02-17 | Lead Architect | Phase 5f2 Followup Fix | **Terminology fix for prompts document (Captain feedback).** Updated 14 missed ClaimBoundary references in CB_Implementation_Prompts.md: 5 type annotations (`ClaimBoundary[]` → `ClaimAssessmentBoundary[]`), 9 narrative text instances ("ClaimBoundary pipeline" → "ClaimAssessmentBoundary pipeline"). Preserved `runClaimBoundaryAnalysis` function name (internal routing ID, 11 instances). Commit 93e15ef.

| 2026-02-17 | Technical Writer | Phase 5g: Documentation | **Comprehensive documentation updates for ClaimAssessmentBoundary pipeline v1.0 (v2.11.0).** All status, governance, and xWiki docs updated. **Status docs:** Current_Status.md (version v2.11.0, pipeline v1.0 production-ready, all 16 phases listed, component health updated, test coverage updated), KNOWN_ISSUES.md (v2.11.0 header, Issue #4 SUPERSEDED by CB, Issue #6 rewritten for CB, added #6b for 8 skipped budget tests V-09), Backlog.md (CB section → Remaining Work with 5i/5k/5h/Step 10, added Deferred to v1.1 table, multiple items SUPERSEDED by CB). **Architecture doc:** ClaimBoundary_Pipeline_Architecture status changed APPROVED → IMPLEMENTED (v2.11.0). **Governance docs (V-03–V-07):** AGENTS.md removed orchestrated.ts refs/[NEW] tags, updated test scripts, fixed AC mention in prompt rules; CLAUDE.md removed orchestrated refs/[NEW] tags, updated migration note. **Package.json (V-08):** Removed dead test:contexts/test:adversarial scripts, updated test:expensive. **xWiki pages:** Pipeline Variant Dispatch (claimboundary default), System Architecture (ClaimAssessmentBoundary Pipeline label), Orchestrated Pipeline Detail (OBSOLETE warning added). **Verification:** Build PASS (21 workers, 23 static pages), Tests PASS (42 files, 817 passed, 8 skipped). | `Docs/STATUS/Current_Status.md`, `Docs/STATUS/KNOWN_ISSUES.md`, `Docs/STATUS/Backlog.md`, `Docs/WIP/ClaimBoundary_Pipeline_Architecture_2026-02-15.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `apps/web/package.json`, 3 xWiki pages (Pipeline Variant Dispatch, System Architecture, Orchestrated Pipeline Detail), `Docs/WIP/CB_Execution_State.md` | None. V-03 through V-08 all resolved. |

## Phase 5f2 Rename Checklist

**Execute after Phase 5f (integration test), BEFORE Phase 5g (documentation).**

**CRITICAL TIMING:** This rename must occur BEFORE Phase 5g so that documentation updates use the final terminology from the start, avoiding double documentation work.

### Rename Strategy: Partial (Types/Docs Only)

**Target:** `ClaimBoundary` → `ClaimAssessmentBoundary`

**Approach:** Keep internal infrastructure IDs unchanged to avoid UCM/config migration.

### Step 1: TypeScript Types and Interfaces

- [ ] `apps/web/src/lib/analyzer/types.ts`:
  - [ ] `interface ClaimBoundary` → `ClaimAssessmentBoundary`
  - [ ] `interface CBClaimBoundary` → `CBClaimAssessmentBoundary`
  - [ ] `interface BoundaryFinding` → `AssessmentBoundaryFinding` (or keep as-is if "Boundary" is sufficient)
  - [ ] All related type references in same file

- [ ] `apps/web/src/lib/analyzer/index.ts`: Update exports

### Step 2: Implementation Code (Variable Names)

- [ ] `apps/web/src/lib/analyzer/claimboundary-pipeline.ts`:
  - [ ] Variables: `claimBoundary` → `claimAssessmentBoundary` or `assessmentBoundary`
  - [ ] Comments: Update terminology
  - [ ] **Do NOT rename:** function name `runClaimBoundaryAnalysis` (internal routing ID)

- [ ] `apps/web/src/lib/analyzer/verdict-stage.ts`: Update variable names + comments

- [ ] `apps/web/src/lib/internal-runner-queue.ts`: Update variable names in CB routing (keep function name)

### Step 3: Test Files

- [ ] `apps/web/test/unit/lib/analyzer/claimboundary-pipeline.test.ts`:
  - [ ] Variables: `claimBoundary` → `claimAssessmentBoundary`
  - [ ] Mock data: Update object literals
  - [ ] Comments and test descriptions

- [ ] `apps/web/test/unit/lib/analyzer/verdict-stage.test.ts`: Update variables + comments

### Step 4: UI Components and Labels

- [ ] `apps/web/src/app/jobs/[id]/components/BoundaryFindings.tsx`:
  - [ ] Variables: `claimBoundaries` → `claimAssessmentBoundaries` (or `assessmentBoundaries`)
  - [ ] UI labels: "Claim Boundaries" → "Claim Assessment Boundaries"
  - [ ] Comments

- [ ] `apps/web/src/app/jobs/[id]/page.tsx`:
  - [ ] Variables: `claimBoundaries` → `claimAssessmentBoundaries`
  - [ ] Badge text: "BOUNDARIES" → "ASSESSMENT BOUNDARIES" (or keep short)
  - [ ] Comments

### Step 5: Documentation

- [ ] `Docs/WIP/ClaimBoundary_Pipeline_Architecture_2026-02-15.md`:
  - [ ] All references: `ClaimBoundary` → `ClaimAssessmentBoundary`
  - [ ] Rename file → `ClaimAssessmentBoundary_Pipeline_Architecture_2026-02-15.md` (optional)

- [ ] `Docs/WIP/CB_Implementation_Plan_2026-02-17.md`: Update all references

- [ ] `Docs/WIP/CB_Implementation_Prompts.md`: Update all references

- [ ] `Docs/WIP/CB_Execution_State.md`:
  - [ ] Update terminology in Confusion Prevention
  - [ ] Update handover log entries (historical — mark as "pre-rename terminology")
  - [ ] Rename file → `CAB_Execution_State.md` (optional)

### Step 6: Governance Documents

- [ ] `AGENTS.md`:
  - [ ] Terminology table: Update `ClaimBoundary` entry to `ClaimAssessmentBoundary`
  - [ ] Update "NEVER call it" column (keep "context, scope")
  - [ ] Update Key Files section if file names changed
  - [ ] Update Confusion Prevention examples

- [ ] `CLAUDE.md`: Update terminology references

- [ ] `Docs/AGENTS/Multi_Agent_Collaboration_Rules.md`: Update if ClaimBoundary appears

### Step 7: Infrastructure (DO NOT CHANGE)

**Keep these unchanged to avoid UCM/config migration:**

- [ ] ❌ **Do NOT rename:** `"claimboundary"` prompt profile (config-storage.ts)
- [ ] ❌ **Do NOT rename:** `claimboundary.prompt.md` file
- [ ] ❌ **Do NOT rename:** `"claimboundary"` pipeline variant enum value
- [ ] ❌ **Do NOT rename:** `"3.0.0-cb"` schema version
- [ ] ❌ **Do NOT rename:** UCM prompt section keys (CLAIM_EXTRACTION_PASS1, etc.)
- [ ] ❌ **Do NOT rename:** Config field names in database

### Step 8: Verification

- [ ] Run `npm run build` — must PASS
- [ ] Run `npm test` — must PASS (all existing tests)
- [ ] Grep verification:
  - [ ] `grep -r "ClaimBoundary" apps/web/src/` — should only find internal IDs (function names, pipeline variant)
  - [ ] `grep -r "claimBoundary" apps/web/src/` — should only find internal routing/config references
  - [ ] `grep -r "ClaimAssessmentBoundary" apps/web/src/` — should find new type names
- [ ] Review changes: ensure internal IDs preserved, user-facing names updated

### Step 9: Commit

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "refactor: rename ClaimBoundary → ClaimAssessmentBoundary (partial)

Partial rename: types, variables, UI labels, and documentation only.
Internal infrastructure IDs unchanged (prompt profile, pipeline variant,
schema version) to avoid UCM/config migration.

Addresses Codex cautions:
- No AGENTS.md 'scope' terminology conflict (keeps 'Boundary')
- Zero UCM/config blast radius (internal IDs unchanged)

Build PASS | Tests PASS

```

### Step 10: Post-Rename Updates

- [ ] Update `CB_Execution_State.md` (or `CAB_Execution_State.md`) handover log
- [ ] Update phase checklist: mark "Post-5k Rename" as ✅ Complete
- [ ] Proceed to final QA

**Estimated effort:** ~1 session (~1-2 hours)
**Risk:** LOW (no infrastructure changes, pure refactor)

## Quick Reference for Agents

### Before writing ANY code, read:
1. `/AGENTS.md` — terminology, safety rules
2. `Docs/WIP/ClaimAssessmentBoundary_Pipeline_Architecture_2026-02-15.md` §22.3.2 — Confusion Prevention Rules
3. This file — to know where we are

### Confusion Prevention (§22.3.2 summary):
- **NEW code**: `ClaimAssessmentBoundary`, `AtomicClaim`, `claimBoundaryId`, `BoundaryFinding`
- **NEVER in new code**: `AnalysisContext`, `contextId`, `analysisContexts`
- **NEVER import from**: `orchestrated.ts`, `analysis-contexts.ts`, `evidence-context-utils.ts`
- **Test fixtures**: CB schema only in new test files
- **Docs update with code**: same phase, not deferred

### Verify after every commit:
```bash
npm run build   # must pass
npm test         # must pass (excludes expensive LLM tests)
```
