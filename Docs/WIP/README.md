# FactHarbor Work In Progress (WIP)

**Last Updated**: 2026-02-22 (Consolidated: 17 files archived, 17 retained)
**Status**: 18 active files — Alpha forward-looking work + active calibration/quality track

---

## Overview

This directory contains **active design proposals, execution plans, and future work items** for the Alpha phase.

**Forward direction:** POC declared complete (`v1.0.0-poc`). The ClaimAssessmentBoundary pipeline v1.0 is production-ready. Two parallel tracks: (1) calibration/quality (bias measurement, quality map B-sequence), (2) Alpha features (cost reduction, test/tuning mode).

For completed work, historical documents, and reference materials, see:
- **[Docs/ARCHIVE/](../ARCHIVE/)** - Completed plans, reviews, and historical documentation
- **[Docs/STATUS/Backlog.md](../STATUS/Backlog.md)** - Consolidated backlog of pending development tasks

## Guidelines

**WIP folder is for:**
- ✅ Active design proposals awaiting prioritization
- ✅ Future research / enhancement proposals
- ✅ Technical assessments for decision-making
- ✅ Active execution plans and decision records

**WIP folder is NOT for:**
- ❌ Completed work (move to ARCHIVE)
- ❌ Implementation tasks (add to Backlog.md)
- ❌ Bug reports (create GitHub issues)
- ❌ Meeting notes (use appropriate location)
- ❌ Completed code reviews (move to ARCHIVE after findings addressed)

**Keep WIP lean**: If a document hasn't been referenced in 3 months and isn't blocking a decision, consider archiving it.

**Consolidate WIP**: When the Captain requests a WIP consolidation, agents follow the **Consolidate WIP Procedure** defined in `/AGENTS.md` § "Consolidate WIP Procedure". This is an interactive process — agents audit each file, sync status docs, archive completed work, and report findings for Captain approval.
