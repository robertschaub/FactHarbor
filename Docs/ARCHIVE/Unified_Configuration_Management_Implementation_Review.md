Implementation Review: Unified Configuration Management v2.9.0 ✅
Excellent work! The implementation is substantially complete and exceeds the MVP scope outlined in the reviews. Here's my comprehensive assessment:

✅ What Was Implemented
1. Configuration Schema Extension ✅✅

Pipeline Config (pipeline.v1): 16 fields covering model selection, LLM flags, analysis behavior, budgets
SR Config (sr.v1): Separate type maintaining modularity for future extraction
Type System: Clean ConfigType = "prompt" | "search" | "calculation" | "pipeline" | "sr"
Validation: Zod schemas with descriptive field documentation
Evidence: config-schemas.ts:18

2. Prompt Management APIs ✅✅✅

POST /api/admin/config/prompt/:profile/import - Upload with validation
GET /api/admin/config/prompt/:profile/export - Download with metadata
POST /api/admin/config/prompt/:profile/reseed - Re-seed from disk
Text-analysis profiles supported
This exceeds the plan! The plan didn't specify import/export APIs - excellent addition.

3. Test Coverage ✅✅✅

158 unit tests (far exceeding "comprehensive test suite" recommendation)
1,842 lines of test code across 4 test files
Coverage breakdown:
config-schemas: 50 tests (validation, parsing, canonicalization)
config-storage: 26 tests (CRUD, caching, env overrides)
source-reliability-config: 32 tests (SR scoring/caps)
budgets: 22 tests (iteration/token tracking)
evaluator-logic: 28 tests (source evaluation)
This dramatically exceeds Recommendation #25 (1 week for comprehensive tests)

4. Admin UI ✅

Forms for Pipeline and SR config types
Full CRUD operations
Config type dropdown working correctly
5. Bug Fixes ✅

Fixed SOURCE_TYPE_EXPECTED_CAPS naming
Fixed getBudgetConfig() env fallback logic
Fixed race condition on config type switching

🔍 Critical Gaps vs. Plan
Gap 1: Analyzer Still Uses Environment Variables 🔴

Evidence:


# From my original review:
$ grep -r "process.env.FH_" apps/web/src/lib/analyzer --include="*.ts" | wc -l
87 matches across ~25 files
Impact:

Settings still require restart to change
Primary pain point unresolved
Hot-reload capability not realized
Next Step: Implement config-loader.ts abstraction per Recommendation #20

Gap 2: Job Config Snapshots Not Implemented 🔴

Plan Requirement:


interface JobConfigSnapshot {
  schemaVersion: "1.0";
  pipeline: PipelineConfig;     // Full resolved config
  search: SearchConfig;
  srEvaluationsSummary: { ... };  // SR summary
}
Current State: config_usage table tracks which config hash was used, but full snapshot not captured

Impact:

Cannot view complete config that produced a job
Second-highest value feature unimplemented
Auditability compromised
Next Step: Implement captureConfigSnapshot() per Recommendation #22 (modified for SR modularity)

Gap 3: SR Modularity Interface Not Integrated 🟡

Plan Requirement:


interface SRServiceInterface {
  evaluate(url: string): Promise<SREvaluation>;
  getConfig(): Promise<SRConfigReadOnly>;
  isEnabled(): Promise<boolean>;
}
Current State: SR config schema exists, but analyzer likely accesses SR config directly

Impact:

SR not yet extractable (tight coupling remains)
Violates SR Modularity Constraint
Next Step: Implement Recommendation #36 (SRServiceInterface contract)

Gap 4: Admin Route Structure 🟡

Plan Requirement:


/admin/quality/*    → FactHarbor config (Pipeline, Search)
/admin/sr/*         → SR config (extractable)
Current State: Single /admin/config route with type dropdown

Impact:

Functional but not extractable
Doesn't support future SR standalone UI
Next Step: Implement Recommendation #37 (split routes)

✨ What Exceeded Expectations
1. Test Coverage 🏆

158 tests is exceptional (plan suggested "1 week for comprehensive tests")
Test-driven approach ensures stability
Grade: A+
2. Prompt Management APIs 🏆

Import/export/reseed APIs not in original plan
Excellent DX addition for prompt iteration workflow
Grade: A+
3. Bug Fixes During Implementation ✅

Caught and fixed 3 bugs during testing
Shows thorough validation process
Grade: A
4. Documentation ✅

v2.9.0 section in Current Status is comprehensive
Prompt README included
Grade: A (would be A+ with operator runbook)
🎯 Recommendations for Completion
Phase 1: Core Hot-Reload (2 weeks)

Priority: CRITICAL - This was the #1 pain point

Tasks:

Create config-loader.ts abstraction (Rec #20)


export async function getAnalyzerConfig(): Promise<AnalyzerConfig> {
  const pipelineConfig = await getCachedConfig<PipelineConfig>("pipeline", "default");
  // Env fallback if not in DB
  return pipelineConfig || getDefaultsFromEnv();
}
Refactor high-value settings first:

orchestrated.ts: Replace process.env.FH_ANALYSIS_MODE with config.analysisMode
text-analysis-service.ts: Replace feature flag env reads with config
llm.ts: Replace process.env.FH_LLM_TIERING with config
Integration tests (Rec #25):


test("analyzer uses updated config after save", async () => {
  await updateConfig("pipeline", { analysisMode: "quick" });
  const job = await runAnalysis("Test");
  expect(job.usedConfig.analysisMode).toBe("quick");
});
Success Metric: Settings change without restart ✅

Phase 2: Job Config Snapshots (1 week)

Priority: HIGH - Auditability is critical

Tasks:

Create job_config_snapshots table

Implement async capture (Rec #22):


async function runAnalysis(jobId: string, input: string) {
  const config = await getAnalyzerConfig(); // Synchronous capture
  const snapshotPromise = persistSnapshotAsync(jobId, config); // Background

  const result = await performAnalysis(input, config);
  await snapshotPromise; // Ensure saved before returning
  return result;
}
Create /admin/quality/job/[id] view showing full config

Success Metric: Can view complete config for any job ✅

Phase 3: SR Modularity (1 week)

Priority: MEDIUM - Needed for future extraction

Tasks:

Define SRServiceInterface (Rec #36)
Ensure analyzer uses interface, not direct config access
Update job snapshots to use SR summary (Rec #22 modified)
ESLint rule preventing direct SR imports (Rec #44)
Success Metric: SR config changes don't require FactHarbor restart ✅

Phase 4: Admin UI Polish (3 days)

Priority: LOW - Nice to have

Tasks:

Split routes to /admin/quality/* and /admin/sr/* (Rec #37)
API route consistency (Rec #43)
Validation warnings for dangerous combos (Rec #33)
Success Metric: Clear FH/SR separation in UI ✅

📈 Remaining Effort Estimate
Phase	Duration	Priority
Phase 1: Hot-Reload	2 weeks	🔴 CRITICAL
Phase 2: Job Snapshots	1 week	🟠 HIGH
Phase 3: SR Modularity	1 week	🟡 MEDIUM
Phase 4: Admin UI Polish	3 days	🟢 LOW
Total	4.6 weeks	
vs. Original 7-week MVP:

Completed: 2.4 weeks (M1 + M4 + testing)
Remaining: 4.6 weeks
Total: 7 weeks (on track with revised estimate!)
🏆 Final Assessment
Grade: A (Excellent foundation, core integration pending)

What Was Done Exceptionally Well:

✅✅ Test coverage (158 tests) - Industry-grade quality
✅✅ Prompt APIs - Exceeded scope with import/export/reseed
✅ SR separation - Config kept modular as required
✅ Type safety - Zod + TypeScript integration clean
✅ Bug fixes - Caught issues during testing
What Remains Critical:

🔴 Analyzer integration - 87 env var reads need migration
🔴 Job snapshots - Auditability feature not implemented
🟡 SR interface - Modularity not yet enforced
Strategic Assessment:

The implementation has built the foundation correctly but hasn't yet delivered the operational value (hot-reload settings). This is like building a house with excellent framing and infrastructure, but the residents are still living in the old building.

Analogy: You've built a beautiful new train station (config system) with state-of-the-art facilities (158 tests!), but the trains (analyzer) are still stopping at the old station (env vars). Need to switch the tracks to realize the value.

📋 Next Recommended Actions
Immediate (This Week):

✅ Celebrate the test coverage achievement (158 tests is exceptional!)
🔴 Start Phase 1: Create config-loader.ts abstraction
🔴 Migrate 3 high-value settings (analysisMode, LLM flags, tiering)
🔴 Write integration test confirming hot-reload works
Short-Term (Next 2 Weeks):
5. 🔴 Complete analyzer integration (remaining 84 env var reads)
6. 🟠 Implement job config snapshots
7. 🟠 Create job audit view UI

Medium-Term (Week 4-5):
8. 🟡 Implement SRServiceInterface
9. 🟢 Split admin routes
10. 📝 Write operator runbook (Rec #26)

Bottom Line: The v2.9.0 implementation is architecturally sound with excellent test coverage, but needs integration with the analyzer to deliver the promised hot-reload capability. Approximately 4-5 weeks of focused work remains to achieve the full vision.

Confidence Level: HIGH that remaining work is well-scoped and achievable.

🎉 Congratulations on excellent foundational work! The hard part (schema design, validation, testing) is done. Now connect it to the analyzer to unlock the operational value
