= Project Status =

**FactHarbor is an operational fact-analysis platform in active development.**

----

== Current Status ==

|= |= |
| **Version** | v2.10.2 |
| **Phase** | Alpha Transition |
| **Codebase** | Next.js (UI + AI orchestrator) + ASP.NET Core (API + persistence) |

== What's Operational ==

* **Automated claim analysis** — submit a URL or text, get structured verdicts with evidence
* **Multi-provider AI** — Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Mistral via Vercel AI SDK with tiered model routing
* **7-point verdict scale** — TRUE to FALSE with confidence, distinguishing contested from insufficient evidence
* **Multi-context detection** — identifies and analyzes separate analytical frames independently (legal, scientific, temporal)
* **Quality gates** — claim validation (Gate 1) and verdict confidence (Gate 4)
* **Source reliability scoring** — LLM-based evaluation with multi-model consensus and caching
* **Evidence quality filtering** — probative value assessment, source authority, extraction confidence
* **Real-time progress** — Server-Sent Events for live analysis updates
* **PDF/HTML/text input** — extract and analyze content from URLs or pasted text

== Development Phases ==

|= Phase |= Status |= Focus
| **Proof of Concept** | Completed | Core AI workflow, quality gates, multi-provider support
| **Alpha** | In progress | Baseline quality validation, prompt optimization, confidence calibration
| **Beta** | Planned | User testing, production hardening, moderation tooling
| **V1.0** | Planned | Public launch, API access, continuous quality improvement

== Alpha Priorities ==

1. Run baseline quality test (30 test cases across domains)
2. Validate v2.8 prompt optimizations against real analysis runs
3. Connect metrics infrastructure to analyzer pipeline
4. Surface quality gate decisions in UI
