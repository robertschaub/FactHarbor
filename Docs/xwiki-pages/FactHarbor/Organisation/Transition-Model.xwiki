(((
**Current Status: Phase 0 (Pre-Alpha / Founder Mode)**
FactHarbor is currently in an early setup phase. Processes described here are being established.
)))
== 1. Purpose ==
The Transition Model explains how FactHarbor evolves from an early experimental phase to a more stable organisation and, eventually, to a federated ecosystem.
== 2. Phases (Illustrative) ==
* **Prototype / Proof of Concept** – Very small core team; focus on validating the basic approach.
* **Beta** – More users and contributors; governance and processes become clearer and more formal.
* **Release 1.x** – Stable operation, documented contributor processes, and clearer separation of roles.
* **Federated Phase** – Multiple instances or partners adopt the model; shared governance principles across a network.
The exact naming and number of phases can be adapted later, but the idea of deliberate transitions should remain.
== 3. Transition Principles ==
* Preserve mission and neutrality during growth.
* Document which responsibilities move from individuals to shared bodies.
* Make role changes and new structures transparent to contributors and users.
* Keep early experimental material accessible as historical context.
== 4. Practical Use ==
This page is intentionally lightweight. More detailed transition plans and roadmaps will be held in project management tools or dedicated XWiki pages when needed.
