= Organisational Model =
FactHarbor operates as a **Swiss Verein** (non-profit association) with a **simple, flat structure** focused on automation over bureaucracy.
== 1. Legal Structure ==
**Entity Type**: Swiss Verein (Association) 
**Jurisdiction**: Switzerland 
**Governed By**: Swiss Civil Code (Art. 60-79)
**Key Characteristics**:
* Non-profit purpose
* Member-based governance
* Democratic decision-making
* Limited liability
* Tax-exempt status (if public benefit)
== 2. Governance Structure ==
=== 2.1 General Assembly ===
**Composition**: All Verein members
**Powers**:
* Elect Governing Team
* Approve annual budget
* Amend statutes
* Decide on major strategic changes
* Dissolve organization
**Meetings**: Annually (+ extraordinary as needed)
=== 2.2 Governing Team ===
**Size**: small group
**Composition**:
* Facilitator (chair)
* Coordinator
* Treasurer
* 0-4 additional team members
**Term**: 2 years (renewable)
**Powers**:
* Strategic direction
* Budget approval
* Policy decisions
* Hiring/firing key staff
* Represent organization externally
**Meetings**: Quarterly (minimum)
=== 2.3 Team Member Roles ===
**Philosophy**: Minimal team, automation-first. Team members improve the SYSTEM, not the DATA.
**Core Principle**: AKEL makes content decisions. Humans monitor system performance and improve algorithms.
**Essential Roles**:
**Technical Coordinator** (1 FTE):
* **Domain**: AKEL performance and infrastructure
* **Monitors**: Processing speed, error rates, resource utilization, algorithm performance metrics
* **Improves**: Algorithms, infrastructure optimization, processing efficiency
* **Does NOT**: Review individual claim verdicts, override AKEL decisions
* **Authority**: Approve technical changes within domain boundaries
* **Decision Method**: Autonomous within domain, consent for cross-domain changes
**Community Coordinator** (1 FTE):
* **Domain**: Community health and feedback loop optimization
* **Monitors**: User feedback patterns, contribution quality trends, community engagement
* **Improves**: Onboarding processes, documentation, feedback mechanisms, community guidelines
* **Does NOT**: Moderate individual disputes (AKEL handles), make content decisions
* **Authority**: Approve community process changes
* **Decision Method**: Autonomous within domain
**Moderators** (part-time):
* **Domain**: Handle AKEL-flagged escalations and system gaming
* **Monitors**: Items AKEL marks for human review (abuse, manipulation attempts)
* **Improves**: Detection algorithms based on observed patterns
* **Does NOT**: Routine content review, override AKEL verdicts
* **Authority**: Handle flagged items, propose detection improvements
* **Decision Method**: Autonomous for flagged items, propose improvements to Technical Coordinator
**Optional Contractors** (as needed):
* Developers: Specific feature development
* Data Scientists: Algorithm research and optimization
* Legal Counsel: Compliance and legal review
* Accountant: Annual audits
**Total Core Staff**: full-timeE + part-time moderators
**Key Distinction**:
* ✅ Team members monitor AGGREGATE metrics and improve SYSTEMS
* ❌ Team members do NOT review individual claims or override AKEL
* ✅ When metrics show problems, fix the ALGORITHM
* ❌ Do NOT manually correct individual outputs
