FactHarbor governance is **simple, transparent, flat, and focused on enabling automation**.
{{include reference="FactHarbor.Organisation.Diagrams.Governance Structure.WebHome"/}}
== 1. Governance Philosophy ==
**Core Principles**:
* **Automation over bureaucracy**: Minimize manual processes
* **Transparency by default**: Open decision-making
* **Community input**: Listen but decide decisively
* **Measured outcomes**: Data drives decisions
* **Adaptive structure**: Evolve as needed
== 2. Organizational Structure ==
**Flat Cooperative Model**:
* Small organization with collaborative teamwork
* No hierarchical management layers
* Decisions by consensus when possible, voting when needed
* Everyone contributes across multiple areas
**General Assembly** → **Governing Team** → **Team Members** 
=== 2.1 General Assembly (All Members) ===
Decides: Governing Team election, statutes, major strategic changes, budget
Meets: Annually
=== 2.2 Governing Team ===
Decides: Strategy, policy, budget allocation, hiring
Meets: Quarterly
Size: small group (Facilitator, Coordinator, Treasurer + others)
=== 2.3 Team Members ===
* **Technical Coordinator**: AKEL & infrastructure
* **Community Coordinator**: Moderators & contributors
* **Moderators** (part-time): Handle abuse/disputes
== 3. Decision Authority ==
**Day-to-day**: Technical Coordinator + Community Coordinator
**Tactical**: Governing Team (simple majority)
**Strategic**: General Assembly (2/3 majority)
== 4. Policy Development ==
**RFC Process** (Request for Comments):
1. Anyone drafts proposal
2. Community discussion 
3. Governing Team reviews and votes
4. Decision published
**Emergency changes**: Technical Coordinator can act immediately, Governing Team ratifies later
== 5. Financial Governance ==
* Annual budget approved by General Assembly
* Two-signature requirement for >CHF 5,000
* Governing Team approval for >CHF 20,000
* Quarterly financial reports
* Annual independent audit
== 6. Automation Governance ==
**Core Principle**: AKEL makes content decisions. Humans make system decisions.
=== 6.1 Decision Boundary ===
**What AKEL Decides (Automated)**:
* All claim verdicts and confidence scores
* All evidence assessments and relevance scores
* All source track record scores
* All risk tier classifications
* All publication decisions
* All scenario extractions
**Rationale**: These decisions must be automated for scale, consistency, transparency, and to avoid human bias. Humans cannot process millions of claims reliably.
**Human Role**: Monitor aggregate performance metrics, identify systematic issues, improve algorithms.
**What Humans Decide**:
**Strategic Decisions** (General Assembly, 2/3 majority):
* Mission and values
* Risk tier policy definitions
* Major architectural changes
* Budget allocation
* Dissolution
**Tactical Decisions** (Governing Team, simple majority):
* Algorithm parameter ranges (within policy)
* Infrastructure investments
* Hiring and role assignments
* Community policies
* Partnership agreements
**Operational Decisions** (Domain Owners, autonomous):
* Technical Coordinator: AKEL performance optimizations, infrastructure changes
* Community Coordinator: Community process improvements, documentation
* Moderators: Handling AKEL-flagged items, detection improvement proposals
**Emergency Decisions** (any team member, ratified by Governing Team):
* Critical security issues
* Legal compliance requirements
* Immediate safety concerns
=== 6.2 Principle: Fix the System, Not the Data ===
**When AKEL makes a "wrong" decision**:
* ❌ Do NOT manually override that specific verdict
* ✅ DO investigate: Is this a systematic issue?
* ✅ DO improve: Change algorithm/policy to handle such cases better
* ✅ DO test: Validate improvement on historical data
* ✅ DO deploy: Roll out improved system
* ✅ DO monitor: Check if metrics improve
**Example**:
* Bad: "AKEL rated this source too low, I'll manually boost it"
* Good: "AKEL consistently under-rates peer-reviewed sources. Let's adjust the scoring algorithm to weight peer-review more heavily."
=== 6.3 Governance of AKEL ===
**Periodic Performance Review**:
* Who: Governing Team + Technical Coordinator
* What: Review AKEL performance metrics, bias audits, user feedback patterns
* Output: Performance report, improvement priorities, policy updates if needed
**Performance Metrics Monitored**:
* Processing speed (P50, P95, P99)
* Success rate and error rate
* Evidence completeness
* Confidence score distribution
* User feedback (helpful/unhelpful ratio)
* Bias indicators (by domain, source type, etc.)
**Triggers for Policy Review**:
* Metrics outside acceptable ranges
* Systematic bias detected
* Major user complaints about fairness
* Legal/compliance concerns
* New domains requiring special handling
**Algorithm Change Process**:
1. Identify issue from metrics
2. Propose solution (RFC - Request for Comments)
3. Test in staging environment
4. Measure impact on historical data
5. Technical Coordinator approves (or escalates to Governing Team for policy changes)
6. Deploy with monitoring
7. Evaluate results
=== 6.4 Human Intervention Criteria ===
**Legitimate reasons to intervene**:
* ✅ AKEL explicitly flags item for human review
* ✅ System metrics show performance degradation
* ✅ Legal/safety issue requires immediate action
* ✅ User reports reveal systematic bias pattern
**Illegitimate reasons** (system improvement needed instead):
* ❌ "I disagree with this verdict" → Improve algorithm
* ❌ "This source should rank higher" → Improve scoring rules
* ❌ "Manual quality gate before publication" → Defeats purpose of automation
* ❌ "I know better than the algorithm" → Then improve the algorithm
=== 6.5 Consent-Based Decision Making ===
**For system changes**, use consent not consensus (from Sociocracy 3.0):
**Consent** = No principled objections
* Faster than consensus
* Respects concerns without requiring full agreement
* "I can live with this and support it"
**Process**:
1. Proposal presented (RFC)
2. Clarifying questions
3. Reactions and concerns
4. Proposer integrates feedback
5. Consent round: Any principled objections?
6. If no objections → Decision made
7. If objections → Integrate and repeat
**Use for**:
* Algorithm changes
* Policy updates
* Infrastructure investments
* Process changes
**Not for**:
* Strategic decisions (use voting)
* Emergency decisions (use autonomous authority)
== 7. Transparency & Accountability ==
**Always public**: Policies, structure, board membership, financials, quality metrics, major decisions
**Published periodically**: Activity reports, metrics, moderation stats
**Internal documentation**: All meetings, decisions, actions retained indefinitely
== 7. Conflict Resolution ==
**User disputes**: Moderator → Appeal to different moderator → Governing Team (final)
**Timeline**: Reasonable timeframe
== 8. Moderation Oversight ==
**Moderator requirements**: high reputation, 6+ months active, clean record
**Review**: Periodically by Community Coordinator and Governing Team
**Appeal**: Any user can appeal promptly
== 9. Code of Conduct ==
**Governing Team**: Act in org interest, disclose conflicts, maintain confidentiality
**Team Members**: Follow procedures, professional conduct, document decisions
**Moderators**: Impartial decisions, respect privacy, respond timely
== 10. Amendment Process ==
**Minor changes**: Governing Team decision
**Major changes**: General Assembly (2/3 vote)
**Emergency**: Governing Team can act, must ratify at next Assembly
