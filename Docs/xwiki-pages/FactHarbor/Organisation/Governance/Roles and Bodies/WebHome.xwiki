= Roles & Bodies =
== 1. Overview ==
This page summarises the main roles and bodies that appear in the Organisation domain.
In a small organisation, one person may hold several of these roles at the same time.
== 2. Executive Roles (Leads) ==
* **Executive Lead** – Ensures coherence across all domains, oversees implementation of Governance decisions, and represents the organisation externally where appropriate.
* **Research & Development Lead** – Owns the technical architecture, data model, and quality of reasoning ALGORITHMS and models (the systems that evaluate claims, not the evaluation outputs).
* **Organisation Lead** – Maintains organisational documentation, governance rules, contributor processes, and the XWiki structure.
* **PR & Care & Marketing Lead** – Oversees communication, user support, campaigns, and community-facing material while respecting neutrality rules.
* **Finance & Compliance Lead** – Maintains the financial ledger, budgeting, reporting, and the conflict-of-interest register.
== 3. Governance Bodies ==
* **Governing Team** – Strategic oversight, compliance monitoring, and resolution of escalated issues.
* **Governance Steward** – Safeguards neutrality, transparency, and fairness of procedures.
== 4. Support Roles ==
Examples of support roles that may be added as the project grows:
* **Infrastructure Manager** – Coordinates hosting, deployment, monitoring, and backups.
* **Repository Steward** – Keeps repositories structured, tagged, and consistent.
* **Process Support Specialist** – Helps contributors follow defined workflows and improves processes.
* **Onboarding Coordinator** – Supports new contributors with documentation and introductory sessions.
== 5. Advisory Roles ==
* **Legal Advisor**
* **Ethics Advisor**
* **Scientific / Domain Advisors**
These advisory roles provide input and critique but do not replace the formal responsibilities of the Governing Team or Executives.
== 5.5 Domain Concept (from [[Sociocracy 3.0>>https://sociocracy30.org/]]) ==
Each role has a **domain** - a clearly defined area of authority and responsibility.
**Domain definition includes**:
* **Purpose**: Why this domain exists
* **Responsibilities**: What this role is accountable for
* **Dependencies**: What this role needs from others
* **Authority**: What decisions this role can make autonomously
* **Constraints**: What boundaries limit this authority
**Examples**:
**Technical Coordinator Domain**:
* Purpose: Ensure AKEL performs optimally
* Responsibilities: System performance, infrastructure, algorithm improvements
* Dependencies: Performance metrics from monitoring, improvement suggestions from community
* Authority: Approve technical changes that don't affect policy
* Constraints: Must use consent-based decision for policy-affecting changes
**Community Coordinator Domain**:
* Purpose: Enable effective community contribution
* Responsibilities: Documentation, onboarding, feedback loops, community health
* Dependencies: User feedback, contribution patterns
* Authority: Approve community process changes
* Constraints: Cannot change technical systems or policies
**Key principle**: Clear domains prevent overlaps, enable autonomous decisions, and clarify escalation paths.
== 6. Principles for Role Design ==
* Responsibilities must be written down and accessible.
* The same person may hold several roles, but conflicts of interest must be declared.
* For sensitive areas (finance, governance, moderation) there should always be at least one other person able to review or approve critical actions.
