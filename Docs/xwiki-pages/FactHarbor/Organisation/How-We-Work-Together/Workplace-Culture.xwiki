**Sociocracy 3.0**:
* Consent-based decisions
* Clear domains
* Empirical approach
* Continuous improvement
* Equivalence
* Accountability
**AI-First Philosophy**:
* Automation over bureaucracy
* Systems thinking
* Metrics-driven improvement
* Scale through code
**Together**: A collaborative, transparent, learning culture that enables both humans and AI to thrive.
== 2. We Engage with Our Users ==
**From BWB**: "We connect with users and empathize with them, listen to their needs, and learn from their insights."
=== 2.1 FactHarbor Application ===
**Our users**:
* Internal: Contributors, moderators, team members
* External: Claim submitters, information seekers, researchers, journalists
**How we engage**:
* ✅ User feedback continuously monitored (helpful/unhelpful ratings)
* ✅ Community forums for discussion
* ✅ Regular user surveys
* ✅ Feedback loops inform system improvements
* ✅ Transparent communication about changes
* ✅ Public roadmap
**User journey consideration**:
* Claim submission → AKEL processing → Verdict → Evidence exploration
* Every step designed for clarity and trust
* User privacy prioritized
* Accessibility important
**User-driven improvement**:
* User feedback patterns → System improvements (not ad-hoc fixes)
* Example: "Users find evidence unclear" → Improve evidence presentation algorithm
* Example: "Users confused by confidence scores" → Better explanation system
=== 2.2 Internal Users (Contributors) ===
**We support contributors**:
* Clear onboarding documentation
* Welcoming community
* Responsive to questions
* Recognize contributions
* Safe to experiment and learn
**We learn from contributors**:
* RFC feedback shapes decisions
