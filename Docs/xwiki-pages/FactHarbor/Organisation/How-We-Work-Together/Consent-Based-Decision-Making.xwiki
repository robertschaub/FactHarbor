= Consent-Based Decision Making =
**From [[Sociocracy 3.0>>https://sociocracy30.org/]]**: A decision-making method for system changes and policies.
== 1. What is Consent? ==
**Consent** = No principled objections to a proposal.
**This is NOT**:
* ❌ Consensus (everyone must agree)
* ❌ Majority voting (51% wins)
* ❌ Unanimity (everyone must enthusiastically support)
**This IS**:
* ✅ "I can live with this and support it"
* ✅ "Good enough for now, safe enough to try"
* ✅ Respects concerns without requiring full agreement
== 2. Why Consent over Consensus? ==
**Consensus problems**:
* Takes too long
* One person can block everything
* Encourages compromise that satisfies no one
* Discourages bold proposals
**Consent advantages**:
* ✅ Faster decisions
* ✅ Respects principled objections
* ✅ Encourages experimentation
* ✅ "Good enough for now" mindset
* ✅ Can evolve decisions over time
**Example**:
* Consensus: "Everyone must love this algorithm change" → Takes weeks, diluted solution
* Consent: "Can everyone support trying this?" → Decision in days, learn from results
== 3. What is a Principled Objection? ==
**Principled objection** = Shows that proposal would:
* Harm the organization
* Violate core principles
* Create unacceptable risk
* Block achieving objectives
**Valid objections**:
* ✅ "This would violate our transparency principle"
* ✅ "This creates security vulnerability"
* ✅ "Our metrics show this will worsen performance"
* ✅ "This conflicts with existing policy X"
**Invalid objections** (preferences, not principles):
* ❌ "I don't like this approach"
* ❌ "I would do it differently"
* ❌ "This is not perfect"
* ❌ "I'm uncomfortable with change"
**Key question**: "Does this make things worse, or just not as good as your preferred solution?"
== 4. Consent Decision-Making Process ==
=== Step 1: Proposal Presentation ===
**Proposer presents**:
* What problem are we solving?
* What is the proposal?
* Why this approach?
* What are the trade-offs?
**Time**: 5-10 minutes
=== Step 2: Clarifying Questions ===
**Purpose**: Understand the proposal, not evaluate it yet
**Questions like**:
* "How does this affect X?"
* "What happens if Y?"
* "Can you explain Z?"
**NOT yet**:
* Concerns
* Suggestions
* Opinions
**Time**: 5-15 minutes
=== Step 3: Reactions & Brief Discussion ===
**Each person shares**:
* Initial thoughts
* Potential concerns
* Suggested improvements
**Proposer listens**, doesn't defend yet.
**Time**: 10-20 minutes
=== Step 4: Amend & Clarify ===
**Proposer**:
* Integrates feedback
* Clarifies misunderstandings
* May amend proposal
* Or explains why not
**Time**: 5-10 minutes
=== Step 5: Consent Round ===
**Each person states**:
* "I consent" (no principled objections)
* "I have an objection: [specific concern]"
**Go around circle systematically**.
**Time**: 5 minutes
=== Step 6: Integrate Objections ===
**If objections raised**:
* Discuss each objection
* Is it principled? (facilitator decides if unclear)
* How can we integrate it?
* Amend proposal
**Then repeat consent round**.
**Time**: Variable (10-30 minutes per objection)
=== Step 7: Celebrate & Document ===
**When consent achieved**:
* ✅ Decision documented
* ✅ Next steps assigned
* ✅ Timeline set
* ✅ Success metrics defined
* ✅ Review date scheduled
**Decision record created** (see [[Decision Processes>>FactHarbor.Organisation.Governance.Decision Processes.WebHome]]).
== 5. When to Use Consent ==
**Use consent for**:
* ✅ Algorithm changes
* ✅ Policy updates
* ✅ Infrastructure investments
* ✅ Process changes
* ✅ Role assignments
* ✅ Community guidelines
**Don't use consent for**:
* ❌ Strategic decisions → Use voting (Governing Team or General Assembly)
* ❌ Emergency decisions → Use autonomous authority
* ❌ Routine operations → Use autonomous authority within domain
* ❌ Content decisions → AKEL decides (not humans at all)
== 6. Roles in Consent Process ==
=== Proposer ===
* Presents proposal
* Answers questions
* Integrates feedback
* Amends as needed
=== Facilitator ===
* Guides process
* Keeps time
* Determines if objections are principled
* Ensures everyone heard
* Remains neutral
=== Participants ===
* Listen actively
* Ask clarifying questions
* Share concerns honestly
* Support decision once made
== 7. Tips for Good Proposals ==
**Make proposals**:
* ✅ Specific and actionable
* ✅ Time-bound (try for 3 months, then review)
* ✅ Measurable (how do we know if it works?)
* ✅ Reversible if possible
* ✅ Good enough for now, safe enough to try
**Avoid**:
* ❌ Vague aspirations
* ❌ Permanent, unchangeable decisions
* ❌ Trying to be perfect
* ❌ Solving every possible edge case
**Example of good proposal**:
"Let's adjust the source scoring algorithm to weight peer-review 20% higher for 3 months and monitor the quality metrics. If evidence completeness doesn't improve by >10%, we'll revert."
== 8. Tips for Good Objections ==
**Raise objections that**:
* ✅ Are specific: "This will cause X problem"
* ✅ Are principled: "This violates Y principle"
* ✅ Suggest alternatives: "What if we instead..."
* ✅ Are about harm, not perfection
**Avoid objections that are**:
* ❌ Personal preferences
* ❌ Fear of change
* ❌ Desire for perfect solution
* ❌ "Not invented here" syndrome
**Ask yourself**: "Will this harm the organization, or just not be my preferred approach?"
== 9. After the Decision ==
**Everyone who participated must**:
* ✅ Support the decision publicly
* ✅ Give it a genuine try
* ✅ Provide constructive feedback
* ✅ Not undermine the decision
**Can you still disagree?**: Yes, internally. But externally, support it.
**Can you revisit?**: Yes, at the scheduled review date, or if metrics show problems.
== 10. Examples ==
=== Example 1: Algorithm Change ===
**Proposal**: "Increase evidence extraction timeout from 5s to 10s to capture more evidence from slow sites."
**Process**:
1. Presentation: Explained problem (missing evidence), solution, trade-off (slower processing)
2. Questions: "How many claims affected?" "What's CPU impact?"
3. Reactions: Concern about processing time, suggestion to A/B test first
4. Amended: Added A/B test requirement, success metric
5. Consent round: All consent
6. Result: Approved with A/B test requirement
=== Example 2: Policy Change ===
**Proposal**: "Add new risk tier A+ for medical life-or-death claims requiring expert review."
**Process**:
1. Presentation: Explained need, proposed criteria
2. Questions: "Who are experts?" "How many claims affected?"
3. Reactions: Objection - "This creates human approval gate, violates automation principle"
4. Discussion: Valid principled objection
5. Amended: "A+ tier requires AKEL to be more conservative (higher evidence bar), not human approval"
6. Consent round: All consent
7. Result: Approved with automation preserved
=== Example 3: Failed Consensus, Successful Consent ===
**Scenario**: Choosing between two database optimization approaches
**Consensus attempt**:
* Team split 50/50
* Argued for weeks
* No decision
**Consent approach**:
* Proposer: "Let's try approach A for 2 months, monitor query times. If not 20% faster, we try B."
* Consent round: Team B supporters say "I prefer B, but can support trying A first with clear metrics."
* Result: Decision in one meeting
== 11. Common Pitfalls ==
**Pitfall 1**: "Silent consent"
* Problem: People consent but don't actually support
* Solution: Facilitator explicitly asks each person
**Pitfall 2**: "Too perfect"
* Problem: Trying to address every edge case before deciding
* Solution: "Good enough for now, safe enough to try"
**Pitfall 3**: "Preference as objection"
* Problem: Personal preferences disguised as principled objections
* Solution: Facilitator asks "How does this harm the organization?"
**Pitfall 4**: "Never revisiting"
* Problem: Treat consent decisions as permanent
* Solution: Always include review date in decision
== 12. Integration with FactHarbor ==
**Applied to**:
* Technical Coordinator decisions (within domain) → Autonomous
* Cross-domain technical decisions → Consent with affected coordinators
* Policy changes → Consent with Governing Team
* Major strategic changes → Voting (General Assembly)
