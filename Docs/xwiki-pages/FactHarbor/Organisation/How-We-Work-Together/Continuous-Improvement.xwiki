* AKEL processing logs
* Error reports
* Community discussions
**Look for**:
* Metrics outside acceptable ranges
* Systematic patterns in errors
* User pain points

=== 3.2 Analyze ===
**Dig deeper**:
* Why is this metric problematic?
* Is this a systematic issue or one-off?
* What's the root cause?
* What patterns exist?
* How widespread is this?
**Tools**:
* Data analysis (SQL queries, dashboards)
* Code profiling
* A/B test results
* User interviews
* Historical comparison
=== 3.3 Hypothesize ===
**Propose explanation**:
* "We believe X is happening because Y"
* "If we change Z, we expect W to improve"
* "The root cause is likely A, not B"
**Make testable**:
* What would prove this hypothesis?
* What would disprove it?
* What metrics would change?
=== 3.4 Design Solution ===
**Propose specific change**:
* Algorithm adjustment

* Process refinement
**Consider**:
* Trade-offs
* Risks
* Rollback plan
* Success metrics
=== 3.5 Test ===
**Before full deployment**:
* Test environment deployment

* A/B testing if feasible
* Load testing if infrastructure
**Measure**:
* Did metrics improve as expected?
* Any unexpected side effects?
* Is the improvement statistically significant?
=== 3.6 Deploy ===
**Gradual rollout**:
* Deploy to small % of traffic first
* Monitor closely
* Increase gradually if successful
* Rollback if problems
**Deployment strategies**:
* Canary (1% → 5% → 25% → 100%)
* Blue-green (instant swap with rollback ready)
* Feature flags (enable for specific users first)
=== 3.7 Evaluate ===
**After deployment**:
* Review metrics - did they improve?
* User feedback - positive or negative?
* Unexpected effects - any surprises?
* Lessons learned - what would we do differently?
=== 3.8 Iterate ===
**Based on results**:
* If successful: Document, celebrate, move to next improvement
* If partially successful: Refine and iterate
* If unsuccessful: Rollback, analyze why, try different approach
**Document learnings**: Update RFC with actual outcomes.

== 5. Metrics-Driven Improvement ==
=== 5.1 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) ===
**AKEL Performance**:
* Processing time (P50, P95, P99)
* Success rate
* Evidence completeness
* Confidence distribution
**Content Quality**:
* User feedback (helpful/unhelpful ratio)
* Contradiction rate
* Source diversity
* Scenario coverage
**System Health**:
* Uptime
* Error rate
* Response time
* Resource utilization
**See**: [[System Performance Metrics>>FactHarbor.Specification.System-Performance-Metrics]]
=== 5.2 Targets and Thresholds ===
**For each metric**:
* Target: Where we want to be
* Acceptable range: What's OK
* Alert threshold: When to intervene
* Critical threshold: Emergency
**Example**:
* Processing time P95
 * Target: 15 seconds
 * Acceptable: 10-18 seconds
 * Alert: >20 seconds
 * Critical: >30 seconds
=== 5.3 Metric-Driven Decisions ===
**Improvements prioritized by**:
* Impact on metrics
* Effort required
* Risk level
* Strategic importance
**Not by**:
* Personal preferences
* Loudest voice
* Political pressure
* Gut feeling
== 6. Experimentation ==
=== 6.1 A/B Testing ===
**When feasible**:
* Run two versions simultaneously
* Randomly assign users/claims
* Measure comparative performance
* Choose winner based on data
**Good for**:
* Algorithm parameter tuning
* UI/UX changes
* Policy variations
=== 6.2 Canary Deployments ===
**Small-scale first**:

* Monitor closely for issues
* Gradually increase if successful
* Full rollback if problems
**Benefits**:
* Limits blast radius of failures
* Real-world validation

* Gather feedback before full release
* Easy enable/disable without redeployment
== 7. Retrospectives ==
=== 7.1 Sprint Retrospectives ===
**Questions**:
* What went well?
* What could be improved?
* What will we commit to improving?
**Format** (30 minutes):
* Gather data: Everyone writes thoughts (5 min)
* Generate insights: Discuss patterns (15 min)
* Decide actions: Pick 1-3 improvements (10 min)
**Output**: 1-3 concrete actions for next sprint
=== 7.2 Project Retrospectives (After major changes) ===

* What actually happened?
* What went well?
* What went poorly?
* What did we learn?
* What would we do differently?
**Document**: Update project documentation with learnings
=== 7.3 Incident Retrospectives (After failures) ===
**After incidents/failures**:
* Timeline: What happened when?
* Root cause: Why did it happen?
* Impact: What was affected?
* Response: How did we handle it?
* Prevention: How do we prevent this?
**Blameless**: Focus on systems, not individuals.
**Output**: Action items to prevent recurrence
== 8. Knowledge Management ==
=== 8.1 Documentation ===
**Keep updated**:
* Architecture docs
* API documentation
* Operational runbooks
* Decision records
* Retrospective notes
**Principle**: Future you/others need to understand why decisions were made.
=== 8.2 Decision Records ===
**For significant decisions, document**:
* What was decided?
* What problem does this solve?
* What alternatives were considered?
* What are the trade-offs?
* What are the success metrics?
* Review date?
**See**: [[Decision Processes>>FactHarbor.Organisation.Decision-Processes]]
=== 8.3 Learning Library ===
**Collect**:
* Failed experiments (what didn't work)
* Successful patterns (what worked well)
* External research relevant to FactHarbor
* Best practices from similar systems
**Share**: Make accessible to all contributors
== 9. Continuous Improvement of Improvement ==
**Meta-improvement**: Improve how we improve.
**Questions to ask**:
* Is our improvement cycle effective?
* Are we measuring the right things?
* Are decisions actually data-driven?
* Is knowledge being captured?
* Are retrospectives actionable?
* Are improvements sustained?
**Periodically review**: How can our improvement process itself improve?
== 10. Cultural Practices ==
=== 10.1 Safe to Fail ===
**Encourage experimentation**:
* ✅ Try new approaches
* ✅ Test hypotheses
* ✅ Learn from failures
* ✅ Share what didn't work
**Not blame**:
* ❌ "Who broke it?"
* ❌ "Why didn't you know?"
* ❌ "This was a stupid idea"
**Instead**:
* ✅ "What did we learn?"
* ✅ "How can we prevent this?"
* ✅ "What will we try next?"
=== 10.2 Data Over Opinions ===
**Settle debates with**:
* ✅ Metrics and measurements
* ✅ A/B test results
* ✅ User feedback data
* ✅ Performance benchmarks
**Not with**:
* ❌ "I think..."
* ❌ "In my experience..."
* ❌ "I've seen this before..."
* ❌ "Trust me..."
=== 10.3 Bias Toward Action ===
**Good enough for now, safe enough to try**:
* Don't wait for perfect solution
* Test and learn
* Iterate quickly
* Prefer reversible decisions
**But not reckless**:
* Do test before deploying
* Do monitor after deploying
* Do have rollback plan
* Do document decisions
== 11. Tools and Infrastructure ==
**Support continuous improvement with**:
**Monitoring**:
* Real-time dashboards
* Alerting systems
* Log aggregation
* Performance profiling
**Testing**:
* Automated testing (unit, integration, regression)
* Test environments
* A/B testing framework
* Load testing tools
**Deployment**:
* CI/CD pipelines
* Canary deployment support
* Feature flag system
* Quick rollback capability
**Collaboration**:
* RFC repository
* Decision log
* Knowledge base
* Retrospective notes
---
**Remember**: Continuous improvement means we're always learning, always testing, always getting better.
