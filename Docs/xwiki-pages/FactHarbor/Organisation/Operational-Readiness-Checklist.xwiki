== 6. Decision Points ==
Strategic decisions needed before implementation:
=== 6.1 Critical Decisions ===
| Decision | Options | Consideration |

| **Code licensing** | MIT / MIT+AGPL | Simpler vs. stronger copyleft |
| **Hosting location** | CH/EU/US | Swiss aligns with mission |
| **AI model** | Open/API | Infrastructure vs. simplicity |
=== 6.2 Organizational Decisions ===
| Decision | Options |
|----------|---------|
| **Governing Team size** | Two minimum, can expand later |
| **Governing Team meetings** | Quarterly minimum |
| **DPO** | Only if/when needed |

* Hosting (start small)
* Email/contact infrastructure
* Legal support as needed

* Availability of help
* Budget constraints
**Approach:**
* Start critical path items early

* Be realistic about capacity
* Iterate after launch
== 14. Final Notes ==
**Don't Let Perfect Be the Enemy of Good:**
You don't need:

* Large team
* Expensive tools
You do need:
* Legal compliance
* Working functionality
* Clear communication
**You can launch with:**
* Yourself initially
* Basic infrastructure
* MVP implementation
* Free/low-cost tools
* Volunteers for help
**Focus on:**
* Legal requirements (non-negotiable)
* Core functionality (working > perfect)
* Good documentation (for future team)
* Clear communication (honest about solo start)
**Scale when:**
* You have users
* You have validation
* Team grows naturally
* Revenue supports it
