== Why FactHarbor Exists ==

**The Problem**
We live in an environment where information conflicts, misleading content spreads fast, and many people lack the time or tools to verify complex claims. Headlines, soundbites, and viral posts often win over careful reasoning, and “fact-checks” frequently reduce everything to a simple verdict without explaining the //why// behind it. The result is frustration, confusion, and growing distrust — not just in institutions, but in the very idea that complex questions can be assessed fairly.

**Our Response**
FactHarbor acts as a navigation system for complex claims. We don’t just say “true” or “false” — we make assumptions, evidence, and context visible so you can form your own judgement. Instead of asking you to trust an authority, we show you how different conclusions are reached, where the evidence is strong or weak, and where reasonable people might still disagree.

== From Claim to Conclusion – Reasoning You Can Trust Because You Can Inspect ==

**What FactHarbor Does**
FactHarbor helps people make sense of contested questions without stripping away nuance. Instead of chasing quick binary verdicts, we break topics into clear, interconnected claims. For each claim, we highlight the context and assumptions it depends on and link directly to the evidence that supports or challenges it.

**Where It Helps**
Whether you’re analyzing public policy, science, or everyday decisions, FactHarbor provides a transparent way to compare perspectives. Our underlying model creates reusable “claim maps” that journalists, educators, and researchers can build on, while remaining accessible to anyone seeking a clear, honest overview.

**Why It’s Trustworthy**
At our core is a simple principle: reasoning must be as transparent as the result. Our rules for structuring claims and weighing evidence are documented in the open — designed to be reviewed, challenged, and improved by you. Trust comes not from authority, but from a process anyone can inspect.

**AI’s Role**
AI is the engine. It searches multiple LLM's (Large Language Models) and the web for evidence, extracts testable claims, assesses sources by track record, actively seeks contradicting evidence, and produces transparent verdicts with confidence scores. It works fast, at scale, and consistently — but always within the rules and policies humans define. Every step of its reasoning is documented and auditable.

**The Human Role**
Humans are system architects, not content judges. They design and refine the rules, prompts, and policies that guide AI behavior — always with neutrality, fairness, and transparency as goals. When results fall short, humans improve the methodology itself, not individual outputs. Fix the system, not the data. This keeps the platform scalable, unbiased, and accountable.

== How It Works: The Core Concepts ==

FactHarbor structures reasoning into transparent, inspectable steps:

* **Claims** – The system extracts the key assertions from your input and identifies what actually needs to be verified. Related statements are grouped together to avoid duplication and keep the analysis focused.
* **Analytical Contexts** – A claim might be well-supported in one context but contradicted in another. FactHarbor identifies the different perspectives, assumptions, and definitions that shape how a claim should be evaluated — and analyzes each one independently.
* **Evidence** – AI searches across fact-checkers, academic studies, reports, and the open web. Each piece of evidence is assessed for quality, relevance, and linked to the specific context it applies to — not just to the claim in general.
* **Source Reliability** – Every source is scored for credibility using multi-model AI evaluation. Track record matters: a peer-reviewed study carries different weight than a social media post.
* **Verdicts** – For each analytical perspective, FactHarbor produces an evidence-based rating (e.g., "Well Supported", "Mixed Evidence", "Contradicted") with explicit confidence levels and full reasoning.
* **Evidence Landscape** – The result is not a single label, but a multi-perspective view showing where a claim is well-supported, where it's contradicted, and where reasonable people may still disagree — with every conclusion traceable back to its sources.

== The Lifecycle: From Input to Verdict ==

Data in FactHarbor flows through a structured, auditable process:

* **Submission:** Registered users submit text or URLs; the system normalises the input.
* **Context Detection:** AI identifies AnalysisContexts and KeyFactors; the pipeline researches each independently.
* **Evidence Handling:** Evidence is retrieved, assessed for quality, and linked.
* **Verdict Creation:** Drafting reasoning and likelihoods for each AnalysisContext.
* **Public Presentation:** The evidence landscape — multi-perspective results with full provenance — is published for users to explore.
