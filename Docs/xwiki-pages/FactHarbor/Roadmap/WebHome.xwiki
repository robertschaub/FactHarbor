== Philosophy ==

**Validate AI automation quality BEFORE building production features**

Each phase builds on proven capabilities from the previous phase. We never skip ahead - if AI quality is insufficient, we improve prompts and algorithms rather than adding manual workarounds.

== Development Phases Overview ==

**POC1: Core Workflow with Quality Gates**

Build:
* Automated claim analysis
* Confidence scoring
* Source evaluation
* Browse/search interface
* User flagging system

* **LLM Provider Abstraction (NFR-14):** Provider-agnostic AI access
 * POC1: Anthropic Claude API primary (Haiku Stage 1, Sonnet Stages 2 & 3)
 * Architecture: Abstract LLMProvider interface, environment config, basic failover
 * Future: OpenAI/Google secondary providers, admin API, cost comparison (POC2/Beta)

**Goal**: Prove AI quality before adding user editing

**User Needs fulfilled in POC1**: UN-1, UN-2, UN-3, UN-4, UN-5, UN-6, UN-7, UN-8, UN-9, UN-12

**POC2/Beta 0: User Contributions**

Add only if needed:
* Simple editing (Wikipedia-style)
* Reputation system
* Basic moderation
* In-article claim highlighting (FR13)

**Additional User Needs fulfilled**: UN-13, UN-17

**V1.0+: Continuous Improvement**

* Continuous quality improvement
* Feature additions based on real usage
* Scale infrastructure

**Additional User Needs fulfilled**: UN-14 (API access)

**Deferred Beyond V1.0**:
* Federation (until multiple successful instances exist)
* Complex contribution workflows (focus on automation)
* Extensive role hierarchy (keep simple)

== Success Metrics Framework ==

**Note**: Each phase defines specific success criteria in detail. This section provides the overall metrics framework.

**System Quality**:
* Error rate by category (target: continuous improvement)
* Average confidence score (target: increase)
* Source quality distribution (target: more high-quality)
* Contradiction detection rate (target: increase)

**Efficiency**:
* Claims processed per hour (target: increase)
* Human hours per claim (target: decrease)
* Automation coverage (target: >90%)
* Re-work rate (target: <5%)

**User Satisfaction**:
* User flag rate (issues found)
* Correction acceptance rate (flags valid)
* Return user rate
* Trust indicators (surveys)

**User Needs Metrics**:
* UN-1: % users who understand trust scores
* UN-4: Time to verify social media claim
* UN-7: % users who access evidence details
* UN-8: % users who view multiple scenarios
* UN-15: % users who check evolution timeline
* UN-17: % users who enable in-article highlighting; avg. time spent on highlighted vs. non-highlighted articles

== Status ==

**Current Phase:** POC1 Specification Complete 
**Next Action:** Begin POC1 Implementation 
**Version:** V0.9.70
