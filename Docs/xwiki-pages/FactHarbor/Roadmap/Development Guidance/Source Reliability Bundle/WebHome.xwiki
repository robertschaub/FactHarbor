{{warning}}
**This page is archived.** The static Source Reliability Bundle approach was replaced by the **LLM-powered Source Reliability Service** in v2.6.

See: [[Source Reliability>>FactHarbor.Specification.Architecture.Deep Dive.Source Reliability.WebHome]]
{{/warning}}

== What Changed ==

|= Aspect |= Old (Bundle) |= New (Service)
| **Data Source** | Pre-seeded MBFC JSON file | LLM-powered on-demand evaluation
| **Storage** | Static JSON file (##source-bundle.json##) | SQLite cache (##source-reliability.db##, 90-day TTL)
| **Configuration** | ##FH_SOURCE_BUNDLE_PATH## env var | UCM SR config in database
| **Evaluation** | Static pre-computed scores | Sequential refinement (Claude + OpenAI cross-check)
| **Coverage** | ~50-9,500 pre-seeded sources | Any source, evaluated on first encounter
| **Multi-language** | N/A | Automatic language detection + regional fact-checkers

== Why ==

* Static bundles quickly become stale
* Limited to pre-seeded sources only
* No cross-verification or confidence scoring
* Could not handle sources not in the bundle

The new service evaluates any source on-demand, caches results, and provides confidence scores with multi-model cross-checking.
