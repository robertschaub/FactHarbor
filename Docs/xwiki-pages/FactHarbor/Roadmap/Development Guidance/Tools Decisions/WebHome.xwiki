= Tools Decisions =

== Purpose ==

This page documents the deliberate tool choices for FactHarbor from **POC1 to Beta**. The guiding principles are:

* minimal setup and cognitive load for POC1
* no rewrites when moving to Beta
* clear, incremental upgrade paths

----

== Phase 1 — POC1 (Local, Low Infrastructure) ==

=== Principles ===

* Local-first development
* No mandatory container or cloud infrastructure
* Same architectural shape as later phases

=== Backend ===

* (((
**ASP.NET Core (.NET 8)**

* Role: system of record (jobs, status, results, events)
* Reason: strong typing, long-term stability, C# expertise
)))
* (((
**SQLite (EF Core provider)**

* Role: local persistence
* Reason: zero setup, file-based, smooth transition to PostgreSQL
)))

=== Frontend & Orchestration ===

* (((
**Next.js (TypeScript)**

* Role: UI and AI orchestration
* Reason: fast iteration, strong ecosystem, good AI tooling
)))
* (((
**Vercel AI SDK**

* Role: LLM abstraction
* Reason: OpenAI-first, Claude-ready, provider switching without rewrites
)))

=== AI Providers ===

* OpenAI (default)
* Anthropic (optional, later)

=== Editors ===

* Visual Studio 2022 — primary for .NET API
* Cursor or VS Code — primary for Next.js / TypeScript

----

== Phase 2 — Transition to Beta ==

=== Changes (No Rewrite) ===

* SQLite → PostgreSQL
* Local execution → hosted environments
* Add authentication, quotas, persistence hardening

=== Additional Tools Introduced ===

* Docker (optional, mainly for DB parity)
* Managed PostgreSQL
* GitHub Actions (CI)
* Hosting:
** Next.js → Vercel
** .NET API → Azure App Service or Container Apps

----

== Explicitly Deferred ==

* Kubernetes
* Microservice decomposition
* Complex distributed queues
* Multi-region deployment

These are intentionally deferred to reduce early risk.

----

== Summary ==

* Architecture is stable from POC1 onward
* Infrastructure is phased, not front-loaded
* Tool choices prioritize clarity and durability over novelty
