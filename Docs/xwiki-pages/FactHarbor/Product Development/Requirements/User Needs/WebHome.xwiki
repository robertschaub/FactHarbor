= User Needs =

This page defines user needs that drive FactHarbor's requirements and design decisions.

**Template**: As a <specific user role>, I want to <action/goal>, so that I can <benefit/outcome>

**Purpose**: User needs inform functional requirements (FR) and non-functional requirements (NFR). Each need maps to one or more requirements that fulfill it.

== 1. Core Reading & Discovery ==

=== UN-1: Trust Assessment at a Glance ===
**As** an article reader (any content type), 
**I want** to see a trust score and overall verdict summary at a glance, 
**so that** I can quickly decide if the content is worth my time to read in detail.

**Maps to**: FR7 (Automated Verdicts), NFR3 (Transparency)

=== UN-2: Claim Extraction and Verification ===
**As** an article reader, 
**I want** to see the key factual claims extracted from content with verification verdicts (likelihood ranges + uncertainty ratings) for each relevant scenario, 
**so that** I can distinguish proven facts from speculation and understand context-dependent truth.

**Maps to**: FR1 (Claim Intake), FR4 (Scenario Generation), FR7 (Automated Verdicts)

=== UN-3: Article Summary with FactHarbor Analysis Summary ===
**As** an article reader, 
**I want** to see an article summary (the document's position, key claims, and reasoning) side-by-side with FactHarbor's analysis summary (source credibility assessment, claim-by-claim verdicts, methodology evaluation, and overall quality verdict), 
**so that** I can quickly understand both what the document claims and FactHarbor's complete analysis of its credibility without reading the full detailed report.

**Maps to**: FR7 (Automated Verdicts), FR6 (Scenario Comparison), FR12 (Two-Panel Summary View - Article Summary with FactHarbor Analysis Summary)

**FactHarbor Summary: AHA Alcohol & Heart Health Statement (2025)**

**Source:** American Heart Association Scientific Statement, //Circulation//, June 2025
**Credibility:** Very High (peer-reviewed expert consensus)

=== The Big Picture ===
**Old belief:** "A glass of wine is good for your heart"
**New position:** We're no longer sure that's true

=== Key Findings ===

|=**Drinking Level**|=**Verdict**
|Heavy (≥3 drinks/day)|(% style="color:red" %)❌ **Harmful** – consistent across ALL studies
|Moderate (1-2 drinks/day)|(% style="color:orange" %)❓ **Uncertain** – benefits may have been overstated
|None|(% style="color:green" %)✅ **Don't start drinking for heart health**

=== Why the Shift? ===
Newer genetic studies (Mendelian randomization) found **no evidence** that moderate drinking protects the heart. The apparent benefits in older studies were likely due to lifestyle differences and methodological bias.

=== AHA Bottom Line ===
(% class="box" %)
(((
If you don't drink, don't start. If you do drink, keep it to ≤2/day (men) or ≤1/day (women). Focus on proven healthy behaviors instead—exercise, diet, not smoking.

//The "wine for heart health" era appears to be over.//

**FactHarbor Analysis Summary**

**Document:** AHA Scientific Statement on Alcohol and Cardiovascular Disease (2025)

=== Source Assessment ===
**Credibility:** (% style="color:green" %)**VERY HIGH**(%%) – Official AHA statement, peer-reviewed, expert panel, published in top journal (//Circulation//)

=== Analysis Findings ===

|=**Claim in Document**|=**FactHarbor Verdict**|=**Confidence**
|Heavy drinking harms heart health|(% style="color:green" %)**STRONGLY SUPPORTED**|(% style="color:green" %)**95%**
|Moderate drinking benefits uncertain|(% style="color:green" %)**WELL SUPPORTED**|(% style="color:green" %)**85%**
|Prior "cardioprotective" claims overstated|(% style="color:green" %)**SUPPORTED**|(% style="color:green" %)**80%**
|More research needed|**APPROPRIATE**|N/A

=== Assessment ===

(% style="color:green" %)✅(%%) **Strengths:** Transparent about methodological limitations, incorporates newer Mendelian randomization evidence, appropriately cautious, avoids overstatement

(% style="color:green" %)✅(%%) **Methodology:** Sound synthesis of observational and genetic evidence

(% style="color:orange" %)⚠️(%%) **Limitation:** Still relies heavily on observational data; RCT evidence limited

=== Verdict on the Statement Itself ===

(% class="box successmessage" %)
(((
**WELL-SUPPORTED SCIENTIFIC SYNTHESIS** – The AHA statement is credible, balanced, and appropriately reflects the current state of evidence. It correctly signals a shift away from previous assumptions about moderate drinking benefits without overclaiming in either direction.

**Key Elements of Two-Panel Layout**:

**Left Panel (Article Summary)**:
* Document title and source
* Source credibility (document's own authority)
* "The Big Picture" - old belief vs. new position
* "Key Findings" - document's main claims in structured format
* "Why the Shift?" - document's reasoning
* "Bottom Line" - document's conclusion

**Right Panel (FactHarbor Analysis Summary)**:
* FactHarbor's source assessment (independent credibility check)
* Claim-by-claim analysis with verdicts and confidence scores
* Assessment of methodology (strengths/limitations)
* Overall verdict on the document itself
* Analysis ID for reference

**Design Principle**: User sees **what they claim** and **FactHarbor's complete analysis** side-by-side without scrolling.

=== UN-4: Social Media Fact-Checking ===
**As** a social media user, 
**I want** to check claims in posts before sharing, 
**so that** I can avoid spreading misinformation.

**Maps to**: FR1 (Claim Intake), FR7 (Automated Verdicts), NFR1 (Performance - fast processing)

=== UN-17: In-Article Claim Highlighting ===
**As** a reader viewing an article, 
**I want** to see factual claims highlighted with color-coded credibility indicators (green for well-supported, yellow for uncertain, red for refuted), 
**so that** I can immediately identify which statements are trustworthy and which require skepticism without interrupting my reading flow.

== 9. User Need Gaps & Future Considerations ==

This section identifies user needs that may emerge as the platform matures:

**Potential Future Needs**:
* **Collaborative annotation**: Users want to discuss verdicts with others
* **Personal tracking**: Users want to track claims they're following
* **Custom alerts**: Users want notifications when tracked claims are updated
* **Export capabilities**: Users want to export claim analyses for their own documentation
* **Comparative analysis**: Users want to compare how different fact-checkers rate the same claim

**When to address**: These needs should be considered when:
1. User feedback explicitly requests them
2. Usage metrics show users attempting these workflows
3. Competitive analysis shows these as differentiators

**Principle**: Start simple (current User Needs), add complexity only when metrics prove necessity.
