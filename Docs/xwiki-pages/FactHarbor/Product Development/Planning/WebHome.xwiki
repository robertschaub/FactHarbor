== Philosophy ==

**Validate AI automation quality BEFORE building production features**

Each phase builds on proven capabilities from the previous phase. We never skip ahead - if AI quality is insufficient, we improve prompts and algorithms rather than adding manual workarounds.

== Development Phases Overview ==

**POC1: Core Workflow with Quality Gates**

Build:
* Automated claim analysis
* Confidence scoring
* Source evaluation
* Browse/search interface
* User flagging system

* **LLM Provider Abstraction (NFR-14):** Provider-agnostic AI access
 * POC1: Multi-provider via Vercel AI SDK (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Mistral)
 * Architecture: UCM Pipeline Config with per-phase model tiering (modelUnderstand, modelExtractEvidence, modelVerdict)
 * Future: Admin UI for provider management, cost comparison dashboards (Beta+)

**Goal**: Prove AI quality through automated analysis

**User Needs fulfilled in POC1**: UN-1, UN-2, UN-3, UN-4, UN-5, UN-6, UN-7, UN-8, UN-9, UN-12

**POC2/Beta 0: Enhanced Features**

Add only if needed:
* UCM admin UI for configuration management
* Basic moderation tooling
* In-article claim highlighting (FR13)

**Additional User Needs fulfilled**: UN-13, UN-17

**V1.0+: Continuous Improvement**

* Continuous quality improvement
* Feature additions based on real usage
* Scale infrastructure

**Additional User Needs fulfilled**: UN-14 (API access)

**Deferred Beyond V1.0**:
* Federation (until multiple successful instances exist)
* Complex contribution workflows (focus on automation)
* Extensive role hierarchy (keep simple)

== Success Metrics Framework ==

**Note**: Each phase defines specific success criteria in detail. This section provides the overall metrics framework.

**System Quality**:
* Error rate by category (target: continuous improvement)
* Average confidence score (target: increase)
* Source quality distribution (target: more high-quality)
* Contradiction detection rate (target: increase)

**Efficiency**:
* Claims processed per hour (target: increase)
* Human hours per claim (target: decrease)
* Automation coverage (target: >90%)
* Re-work rate (target: <5%)

**User Satisfaction**:
* User flag rate (issues found)
* Correction acceptance rate (flags valid)
* Return user rate
* Trust indicators (surveys)

**User Needs Metrics**:
* UN-1: % users who understand trust scores
* UN-4: Time to verify social media claim
* UN-7: % users who access evidence details
* UN-8: % users who view multiple analysis contexts
* UN-15: % users who check evolution timeline
* UN-17: % users who enable in-article highlighting; avg. time spent on highlighted vs. non-highlighted articles

== Status ==

**Current Phase:** Alpha Transition
**Status:** Core workflow operational — claim analysis, evidence extraction, verdict generation, quality gates, source reliability, and multi-provider LLM support all implemented. Baseline quality test is the single blocker for declaring POC complete and entering Alpha.
**Version:** v2.10.2
**Agreed Roadmap:** POC -> Alpha -> Beta -> V1.0 (see [[POC to Alpha Transition>>FactHarbor.Product Development.Planning.POC to Alpha Transition.WebHome]])
