**FactHarbor is an operational fact-analysis platform. POC phase is complete.**

----

== Current Status ==

|= |= |
| **Version** | v2.11.0 (Code) · 3.0.0-cb (Schema) · ##v1.0.0-poc## (Tag) |
| **Phase** | **POC Complete** — entering Alpha |
| **Codebase** | Next.js (UI + AI orchestrator) + ASP.NET Core (API + persistence) |
| **Tests** | 853 passing (45 test files, all mocked — no LLM API calls) |
| **Build** | Clean |

== POC Closure (2026-02-19) ==

{{success}}
**The Proof of Concept is complete.** The ClaimAssessmentBoundary pipeline v1.0 demonstrates end-to-end automated claim analysis: claim extraction, evidence gathering from web sources, evidence-emergent boundary clustering, LLM-based verdicts with debate pattern, and quality-gated aggregation. Tagged as ##v1.0.0-poc##.
{{/success}}

== What's Operational ==

* **ClaimAssessmentBoundary pipeline** — 5-stage architecture (extract claims, research evidence, cluster boundaries, generate verdicts, aggregate assessment)
* **LLM debate pattern** — advocate/challenger/reconciliation for verdict quality
* **Multi-provider AI** — Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Mistral via Vercel AI SDK with tiered model routing
* **7-point verdict scale** — TRUE to FALSE with confidence, distinguishing contested from insufficient evidence
* **Quality gates** — claim validation (Gate 1) and verdict confidence (Gate 4)
* **Source reliability scoring** — LLM-based evaluation with multi-model consensus and caching
* **Evidence quality filtering** — probative value assessment, source authority, extraction confidence
* **Input neutrality** — question vs statement phrasing within +/-4% tolerance
* **Unified Configuration Management** — runtime-configurable parameters, admin UI, hot-reload
* **Real-time progress** — Server-Sent Events for live analysis updates
* **PDF/HTML/text input** — extract and analyze content from URLs or pasted text
* **Rich HTML report export** — self-contained dark-themed reports

== Development Phases ==

|= Phase |= Status |= Focus
| **Proof of Concept** | **Complete** (##v1.0.0-poc##) | Core AI workflow, CB pipeline, quality gates, multi-provider support, UCM
| **Alpha** | Starting | Cost optimization, quality validation, UI polish, dead code cleanup
| **Beta** | Planned | User testing, production hardening, security, PostgreSQL migration
| **V1.0** | Planned | Public launch, API access, continuous quality improvement

== Alpha Priorities ==

1. Cost reduction (Batch API, prompt caching, NPO/OSS credits)
2. Quality validation with real LLM calls (claim fidelity, AtomicClaim extraction)
3. UI polish (quality gate display, CB admin config, coverage matrix)
4. Dead code cleanup
5. Security hardening — before any public deployment
