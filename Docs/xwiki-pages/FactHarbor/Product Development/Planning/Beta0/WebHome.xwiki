= Beta: User Testing & Production Readiness =

**Phase Goal:** Real user testing with corrections system and essential security

**Success Metric:** User satisfaction, essential production features functional

== 1. Overview ==

Beta 0 adds user-facing features and essential production infrastructure:

* User corrections notification system
* Archive.org integration (evidence persistence)
* Essential security controls
* Beta tester program

**Key Innovation:** First real users testing the system

== 2. Requirements ==

=== FR45: Corrections Notification System (Basic) ===

**IFCN Compliance Requirement**

**Mechanisms:**

1. In-page banner (persistence period TBD)
2. Public correction log
3. Email notifications (opt-in)

**Target:** Corrections visible promptly

=== FR47: Archive.org Integration ===

**Evidence Persistence**

**Functionality:**

* Auto-archive all evidence sources
* Fallback to archived version if original unavailable
* Periodic re-archiving for frequently viewed claims

**Target:** High percentage of evidence archived

=== NFR12: Security Controls (Essential) ===

**Production Readiness**

**Requirements:**

1. Input validation (SQL injection, XSS, CSRF prevention)
2. Rate limiting
3. HTTPS everywhere
4. Basic authentication for admin functions

**Target:** 0 critical/high security vulnerabilities

== 3. Beta Testing Program ==

**Recruitment:**

* Multiple beta testers
* Mix: journalists, researchers, fact-checkers, general users

**Testing Protocol:**

* Structured testing period
* Guided tasks + free exploration
* Satisfaction survey
* Bug reporting system

**Success Metric:** Satisfactory user feedback

== 4. Success Criteria ==

* ✅ Beta testers recruited and completed testing
* ✅ User satisfaction meets target
* ✅ Corrections system working (all mechanisms)
* ✅ Archive.org integration operational
* ✅ Security audit: 0 critical/high issues
* ✅ Quality gates still maintaining <5% hallucinations
