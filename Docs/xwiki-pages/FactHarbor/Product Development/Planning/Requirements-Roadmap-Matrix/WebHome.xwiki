== Phase Definitions ==

|= Phase |= Goal |= Key Focus
| **POC** | Prove AI can analyze claims automatically | Core workflow + quality gates + AnalysisContext detection (**Feature-complete at v2.10.2**, pending baseline test)
| **POC2** | Improve reliability and robustness | Merged into Alpha/Beta
| **Alpha** | Quality measurement + optimization | Baseline testing, caching, quality improvements based on empirical data
| **Beta** | User testing with limited audience | Production readiness, user features, security, PostgreSQL
| **V1.0** | Public production launch | IFCN compliance, search visibility
| **V1.x** | Feature expansion | Advanced capabilities, browser extensions
| **V2.0+** | Advanced capabilities | Video verification, OSINT, federation

**Phase Philosophy:** Each phase builds on proven capabilities from previous phases. We validate AI quality before adding production features.

== Requirement Categories ==

**This matrix covers ALL requirements from the baseline:**

**1. Functional Requirements (24 total)**
* **FR1-FR13**: Core workflow and POC requirements
* **FR44-FR54**: Advanced features and future enhancements
* **FR14-FR43**: Numbers reserved (not used)

**2. Non-Functional Requirements (9 total)**
* **NFR1-NFR5**: Basic quality attributes (Performance, Scalability, Transparency, Security & Privacy, Maintainability)
* **NFR11-NFR14**: Formal quality, security, metrics, and LLM abstraction requirements

**3. User Needs (20 total)**
* **UN-1 to UN-28**: User requirements (with some gaps in numbering)

{{warning}}
**Future Requirement Numbering:** To avoid conflicts with existing requirements, new requirements will use:
* **FR55-FR84** for future functional requirements
* **NFR14-NFR18** for future non-functional requirements 
* **UN-29 to UN-36** for future user needs

See [[Gap Analysis>>FactHarbor.Product Development.Requirements.GapAnalysis]] for features not yet assigned formal requirement numbers.

== Requirements by Phase ==

**Note:** Requirements organized by phase, with Formal requirements listed first, followed by POC-specific implementation details.

=== POC1 ===

**Goal:** Prove that AI can extract claims and determine verdicts automatically

**Experimental Feature:** Context-aware analysis (tests if article credibility differs from claim average)

**Requirements:** 2 formal + 9 POC-specific

==== Formal Requirements ====

|= ID |= Title |= Importance |= Urgency |= Notes
| **FR7** | Automated Verdicts (Enhanced with Quality Gates) | CRITICAL | HIGH | Core AKEL capability - system cannot function without automated verdict generation
| **FR4** | Analysis Summary (Enhanced with Context-Aware Analysis) | HIGH | HIGH | Enhanced in POC1 to test context-aware analysis (experimental feature). If successful (≥70% accuracy), ships in POC2. See [[Article Verdict Problem>>FactHarbor.Product Development.Specification.POC.Article-Verdict-Problem]]

==== POC-Specific Requirements ====

| **NFR14** | LLM Provider Abstraction | HIGH | HIGH | Provider-agnostic architecture, no vendor lock-in, POC1 implements with Anthropic primary
|= ID |= Title |= Notes
| **FR1** | Claim Intake | Part of FR7 implementation
| **FR2** | Claim Normalization | Part of FR7 implementation
| **FR3** | Claim Classification | Part of FR7 implementation
| **FR5** | Evidence Linking | Part of FR7 implementation
| **FR6** | Scenario Comparison | Part of FR7 implementation
| **FR12** | Two-Panel Summary View (Article Summary with FactHarbor Analysis Summary) | Part of FR4 implementation
| **NFR1** | Performance | Basic implementation
| **NFR2** | Scalability | Basic implementation
| **NFR3** | Transparency | Basic implementation

**Context-Aware Analysis Details:**
* **Approach:** Single-Pass Holistic Analysis (Approach 1)
* **Implementation:** Enhanced AI prompt to evaluate logical structure
* **Testing:** 30-article test set (10 straightforward, 10 misleading, 10 complex)
* **Success Criteria:** ≥70% accuracy detecting misleading articles
* **Decision Path:** If ≥70% → ship in POC2; if 50-70% → try weighted aggregation; if <50% → defer
* **Cost:** Zero increase (no additional API calls, no architecture changes)
* **Documentation:** [[Article Verdict Problem>>FactHarbor.Product Development.Specification.POC.Article-Verdict-Problem]]
