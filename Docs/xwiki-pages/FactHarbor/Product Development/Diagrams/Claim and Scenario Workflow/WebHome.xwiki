**Current Implementation (v2.10.2)** — The pipeline uses **AnalysisContexts** (bounded analytical frames) and **KeyFactors** (decomposition questions with contestation tracking), discovered during the understanding phase.

== Quality Gates (Implemented) ==

|= Gate |= Name |= Purpose |= Pass Criteria
| **Gate 1** | Claim Validation | Filter non-factual claims | Factual, opinion score 0.3 or less, specificity 0.3 or more
| **Gate 4** | Verdict Confidence | Ensure sufficient evidence | 2 or more sources, avg quality 0.6 or more, agreement 60% or more

//Gates 2 (Contradiction Search) and 3 (Uncertainty Quantification) are not yet implemented.//

== KeyFactors (Replaces Scenarios) ==

**KeyFactors** are optional decomposition questions discovered during the understanding phase:
* Not stored as separate entities
* Help break down complex claims into checkable sub-questions
* See [[KeyFactors Design>>FactHarbor.Product Development.Specification.Architecture.Deep Dive.KeyFactors Design.WebHome]] for design rationale

== 7-Point Verdict Scale ==

* **TRUE** (86-100%) - Claim is well-supported by evidence
* **MOSTLY-TRUE** (72-85%) - Largely accurate with minor caveats
* **LEANING-TRUE** (58-71%) - More evidence supports than contradicts
* **MIXED** (43-57%, high confidence) - Roughly equal evidence both ways
* **UNVERIFIED** (43-57%, low confidence) - Insufficient evidence to determine
* **LEANING-FALSE** (29-42%) - More evidence contradicts than supports
* **MOSTLY-FALSE** (15-28%) - Largely inaccurate
* **FALSE** (0-14%) - Claim is refuted by evidence
