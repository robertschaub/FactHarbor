= Role Descriptions =

|= Role |= Purpose |= Current Status
| **Reader (Guest)** | Anonymous browsing, searching, and viewing | Implemented (all users)
| **User (Registered)** | Submit URLs/text for analysis (rate-limited) | Not yet implemented (no auth)
| **UCM Administrator** | Manage UCM configuration, view audit trail | Partially implemented (CLI/direct DB)
| **Moderator** | Handle abuse, enforce community guidelines | Not yet implemented

= Current Implementation =

All users are anonymous **Readers**:
* Can view analysis results
* Can browse and search published analyses
* No persistent accounts (no authentication system yet)
* No submission rate limiting (single-user development mode)

= Design Principles =

* **No data editing** — analysis outputs are immutable
* **Improve the system, not the data** — UCM Administrators tune configuration to improve quality
* **Moderators handle abuse only** — not content quality (that is automated)
* **Low barrier to entry** — anyone can browse and search without registration; submission requires a free account
* **Rate-limited submissions** — LLM inference and web search are not free; registered users have configurable quotas
