= Federation & Decentralization =
**Status**: 🔮 **Planned for V2.0+** (not in V1.0 scope)
FactHarbor is designed to eventually support federation, but this feature is **deferred until core product is proven and user demand exists**.
== V1.0 Scope (Current) ==
**Single-node deployment**:
* Full-featured standalone instance
* Read replicas for scaling if needed
* All features available without federation
* Focus on core product quality
**Why defer federation**:
* Adds massive complexity (sync, conflicts, identity, governance)
* Not needed for first 10,000 users
* Core product must be proven first
* Build when users explicitly request it
== V2.0+ Federation (Future Vision) ==
**Implement federation when**:
* ✅ 10,000+ users on single node
* ✅ Users explicitly request decentralization
* ✅ Core product is stable and mature
* ✅ Geographic distribution becomes necessary
=== Federation Features (Future) ===
**Independent FactHarbor Instances**:
* Each node operates autonomously
* Local governance and moderation
* Regional data sovereignty
* Domain specialization possible
**Claim Synchronization**:
* Claims propagate between trusted nodes
* Conflict resolution protocols
* Distributed consensus on verdicts
* Maintain source attribution
**Federated Identity**:
* Users recognized across nodes
* Reputation portable (with consent)
* Single sign-on capabilities
* Privacy-preserving authentication
**Decentralized Governance**:
* Each node sets own policies
* Collaborative standards development
* Inter-node arbitration for disputes
* Federation-level oversight (optional)
=== Technical Architecture (Future) ===
**Sync Protocol**:
* ActivityPub-inspired messaging
* Claim deltas and updates
* Source verification across nodes
* Bandwidth-efficient synchronization
**Identity Management**:
* Decentralized identifiers (DIDs)
* Verifiable credentials
* Public key infrastructure
* Privacy-preserving authentication
**Data Sovereignty**:
* Each node controls own data
* Cross-node queries (opt-in)
* GDPR compliance per jurisdiction
* Right to be forgotten respected
=== Benefits of Federation (Future) ===
**Resilience**:
* No single point of failure
* Censorship resistance
* Geographic redundancy
* Community ownership
**Autonomy**:
* Local governance
* Regional moderation policies
* Cultural sensitivity
* Domain specialization
**Scalability**:
* Horizontal growth through new nodes
* Regional distribution reduces latency
* Load distribution across federation
* Independent scaling per node
**Trust**:
* Decentralized verification
* Multiple independent sources
* Transparent provenance
* Community validation
=== Challenges to Address (Future) ===
**Technical Complexity**:
* Synchronization protocols
* Conflict resolution
* Network reliability
* Performance at scale
**Governance Complexity**:
* Inter-node standards
* Dispute resolution
* Quality consistency
* Abuse handling
**User Experience**:
* Node discovery
* Identity management
* Seamless cross-node interaction
* Performance transparency
== Why Not V1.0? ==
**Reality check**:
* Most successful platforms start centralized (Wikipedia, Reddit, GitHub)
* Federation can be added later (see: Mastodon, Matrix)
* Core product quality matters more than architecture philosophy
* Users don't care about federation until they need it
**Build federation when**:
* Users say "I want to run my own instance"
* Censorship becomes a real problem
* Geographic distribution is required
* Community governance demands it
Until then: **Focus on making the core product excellent** 🎯

== Historical Note ==
Earlier specification versions included detailed federation specifications. These have been moved to future vision documents. The federation architecture is well-designed and ready to implement when the time comes — not before V2.0+.
