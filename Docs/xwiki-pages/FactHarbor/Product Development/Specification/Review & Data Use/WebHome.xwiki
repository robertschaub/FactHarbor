== 1. User & Role Concepts ==

* **READER**: Default role for anonymous visitors (guest). Can browse, search, and view published analyses.
* **USER**: Registered role (requires login). Can submit URLs/text for analysis (rate-limited), flag issues, and view submission history.
* **UCM_ADMINISTRATOR**: Appointed role. Manages UCM configuration (prompt templates, quality thresholds, model selection). All config changes are versioned and auditable.
* **MODERATOR**: Appointed role. Handles abuse, spam, and harassment. Does NOT manage content quality (that is automated).
* **TECHNICAL_USER**: Strictly technical identities (services, federation components, background jobs).
* **FEDERATION_NODE**: Technical entity representing a participating node in the federation (future).

== 2. UCM Configuration Actions ==

The system logs every significant configuration change:
* **CONFIG_CHANGE** logs who changed which config, when, and why.
* Fields: ##ConfigBlobHash##, ##ConfigType##, ##ChangedBy##, ##ChangeReason##, ##Timestamp##.
* Every analysis job records the config snapshot used via **config_usage**.
* Reports reference the exact UCM configuration state at time of analysis.
