= FactHarbor Summary: AHA Alcohol & Heart Health Statement (2025) =

**Source**: American Heart Association Scientific Statement, //Circulation//, June 2025
**Credibility**: Very High (peer-reviewed expert consensus)

----

=== The Big Picture ===

**Old belief**: "A glass of wine is good for your heart"
**New position**: **We're no longer sure that's true**

----

=== Key Findings ===

|=Drinking Level|=Verdict
|**Heavy (≥3 drinks/day)**|❌ Harmful – consistent across ALL studies
|**Moderate (1-2 drinks/day)**|❓ Uncertain – benefits may have been overstated
|**None**|✅ Don't start drinking for heart health

----

=== Why the Shift? ===

Newer genetic studies (Mendelian randomization) found **no evidence** that moderate drinking protects the heart. The apparent benefits in older studies were likely due to lifestyle differences and methodological bias.

----

=== AHA Bottom Line ===

>**If you don't drink, don't start. If you do drink, keep it to ≤2/day (men) or ≤1/day (women). Focus on proven healthy behaviors instead—exercise, diet, not smoking.**
