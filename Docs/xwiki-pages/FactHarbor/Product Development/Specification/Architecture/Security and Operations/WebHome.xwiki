= Security and Operations =

This page documents FactHarbor's current security model, deployment topology, user roles, and operational considerations. It distinguishes between what is implemented today (POC) and what is planned for production.

== Security Model ==

{{include reference="FactHarbor.Product Development.Diagrams.Security Model.WebHome"/}}

//Green = implemented in current POC. Yellow = planned for Alpha/Beta. Blue = always active regardless of deployment phase. The current security model protects internal endpoints with shared secrets; full user authentication is planned for Alpha.//

=== Current Protections ===

|= Protection |= Scope |= Mechanism
| Runner route | ##/api/internal/run-job## | ##x-runner-key## header must match ##FH_INTERNAL_RUNNER_KEY## env var
| Admin endpoints | System health POST, config changes | ##X-Admin-Key## header must match ##FH_ADMIN_KEY## env var
| Secret comparison | All key validations | Timing-safe comparison (prevents timing attacks)
| Input validation | All API inputs, all configs | Zod schema validation
| SQL injection | All database access | Parameterised queries (EF Core + better-sqlite3)

=== Production Hardening Needed ===

* **User authentication** — Login, registration, session management
* **RBAC** — Role-based access control (Reader, User, Admin, Moderator)
* **SSRF protection** — Sanitise URLs before fetching (prevent internal network access)
* **Rate limiting** — Per-user and per-IP request throttling
* **CORS tightening** — Restrict allowed origins in production
* **Audit logging** — Track all significant administrative actions

== Deployment Topology ==

{{include reference="FactHarbor.Product Development.Diagrams.Deployment Topology.WebHome"/}}

//Current deployment: single host with both services and SQLite files. Target production: load-balanced API servers, auto-scaling AKEL workers, PostgreSQL with read replicas, optional Redis for shared caching, and Prometheus/Grafana monitoring.//

=== Current Development Setup ===

{{code}}
# Terminal 1: Start C# API
cd apps/api && dotnet run --configuration Development
# Runs on http://localhost:5000, Swagger at /swagger

# Terminal 2: Start Next.js dev server
cd apps/web && npm run dev
# Runs on http://localhost:3000
{{/code}}

=== CI/CD Pipeline ===

|= Stage |= Runner |= Actions
| Build | Windows (GitHub Actions) | Node 20 setup, .NET 8 setup, ##npm ci##, ##npm build## (Next.js), ##dotnet build## (.NET Release)

== User Roles ==

{{include reference="FactHarbor.Product Development.Diagrams.Role-Based Access Control.WebHome"/}}

//Two roles are currently implemented: anonymous Reader (view only) and UCM Admin (configuration management via admin key). Registered User and Moderator roles are planned for Alpha/Beta.//

|= Role |= Status |= Capabilities
| **Reader** | Implemented | View published analyses and reports
| **UCM Admin** | Implemented | Change pipeline/search/calculation configs, resume/pause system, view system health
| **Registered User** | Planned (Alpha) | Submit articles/claims for analysis, view own job history
| **Moderator** | Planned (Beta) | Review flagged content, manage user access, investigate abuse

== Monitoring and Observability ==

=== Current (POC) ===

|= Capability |= Status |= Mechanism
| System health endpoint | Implemented | ##GET /api/fh/system-health## — provider circuit state, pause status
| Provider health banner | Implemented | UI banner when system is auto-paused
| Job event streaming | Implemented | SSE events for real-time progress tracking
| Analysis metrics | Implemented | Per-job metrics stored in ##AnalysisMetrics## table
| Debug logging | Implemented | ##FH_DEBUG_LOG_PATH## for detailed pipeline logs

=== Planned (Production) ===

|= Capability |= Technology |= When
| Metrics collection | Prometheus | Beta
| Dashboards | Grafana | Beta
| Alerting | Prometheus Alertmanager | Beta
| Distributed tracing | OpenTelemetry | V1.0
| Log aggregation | ELK or Loki | V1.0

=== Key Metrics to Track ===

|= Category |= Metrics
| **Performance** | AKEL processing time, API response time, LLM call latency, search latency
| **Quality** | Confidence score distribution, evidence count per analysis, Gate 4 pass rate
| **Cost** | LLM tokens consumed, search API calls, cost per analysis
| **Reliability** | Provider failure rate, circuit breaker trips, auto-pause events

== Disaster Recovery ==

|= Aspect |= Current (POC) |= Target (Production)
| **Backups** | Manual SQLite file copy | Automated PostgreSQL backups to S3
| **Recovery** | Restore SQLite files | Point-in-time recovery from transaction logs
| **Replication** | None (single instance) | PostgreSQL streaming replication
| **RTO** | Manual (hours) | < 4 hours
| **Data loss window** | Since last backup | Minutes (WAL-based)
