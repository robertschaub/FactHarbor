= Source Reliability: Configuration and Scoring =

== Configuration ==

Source Reliability is configured via UCM as a **separate SR config type** (schemaVersion ##3.0.0##). Edit it in
**Admin -> Config -> Source Reliability**. This SR config is owned by the SR service and is separate
from the main pipeline/search/calculation configs.

=== SR Config Independence ===

While SR config is stored in UCM alongside pipeline/search configs, it maintains
operational independence:

* **Schema versioning:** ##3.0.0## for SR (independent of pipeline config versioning)
* **Hot reload:** SR config changes apply to new evaluations only
* **No cascading invalidation:** SR updates don't trigger pipeline/search config reloads
* **Separate domain:** SR uses ##getConfig("sr")## and ##setSourceReliabilityConfig()##

=== Core Settings (UCM) ===

|= Field |= Default |= Description
| ##enabled## | ##true## | Enable/disable source reliability
| ##multiModel## | ##true## | Use multi-model consensus
| ##openaiModel## | ##gpt-4o-mini## | Secondary model for consensus
| ##confidenceThreshold## | ##0.8## | Min LLM confidence to accept score
| ##consensusThreshold## | ##0.20## | Max score difference between models
| ##defaultScore## | ##0.5## | Default score for unknown sources (neutral center)

=== Cache and Filtering (UCM) ===

|= Field |= Default |= Description
| ##cacheTtlDays## | ##90## | Cache expiration in days
| ##filterEnabled## | ##true## | Enable importance filter
| ##skipPlatforms## | //(defaults in config)// | Platform domains to skip
| ##skipTlds## | //(defaults in config)// | TLDs to skip

=== Rate Limiting (UCM) ===

|= Field |= Default |= Description
| ##rateLimitPerIp## | ##10## | Max evaluations per minute per IP
| ##domainCooldownSec## | ##60## | Seconds between same-domain evals

=== Evaluator Evidence Grounding (UCM SR Config) ===

These settings affect the internal evaluation endpoint (##/api/internal/evaluate-source##):

|= Field |= Default |= Description
| ##evalUseSearch## | ##true## | Build an evidence pack from web search
| ##evalSearchMaxResultsPerQuery## | ##3## | Max search results per query for the evidence pack
| ##evalMaxEvidenceItems## | ##12## | Max evidence-pack items to include
| ##evalSearchDateRestrict## | ##null## | Optional: ##y## / ##m## / ##w## (falls back to SearchConfig ##dateRestrict##)

=== Environment Variables (infra only) ===

|= Variable |= Default |= Description
| ##FH_SR_CACHE_PATH## | ##./source-reliability.db## | SQLite database location

=== Example SR Config (JSON) ===

== Score Interpretation ==

**7-band credibility scale (centered at 0.5)**

|= Score |= Rating |= Key Criteria
| 0.86-1.00 | Highly Reliable | Verified accuracy, recognized standards body, rigorous corrections
| 0.72-0.85 | Reliable | Consistent accuracy, professional standards, rarely faulted
| 0.58-0.71 | Leaning Reliable | Often accurate, occasional errors, corrects when notified
| 0.43-0.57 | Mixed | Variable accuracy OR inconsistent quality by topic/author
| 0.29-0.42 | Leaning Unreliable | Often inaccurate OR bias significantly affects reporting
| 0.15-0.28 | Unreliable | Pattern of false claims OR ignores corrections
| 0.00-0.14 | Highly Unreliable | Fabricates content OR documented disinformation source

**Calibration:**
* Default assumption is 0.5 (mixed). Adjust up or down based on evidence.
* Do not inflate scores based on brand recognition or reputation alone.
* "No negative findings" does not equal reliable. Absence of evidence lowers confidence; truly unknown sources should use insufficient_data.

**Negative-side calibration (POC intent):**
* **platform_ugc**: If a domain is primarily an open UGC platform without centralized editorial verification, it should generally land **below the mixed band** unless evidence shows consistent domain-level verification and corrections.
* **state_controlled_media**: If evidence indicates editorial coordination/control, default below mixed unless evidence shows meaningful editorial independence and correction practices.
* **propaganda_outlet / known_disinformation**: If evidence indicates repeated independent debunks / multiple independent assessors flagging systemic misinformation, score should land in **0.00-0.20** even if occasional factual content exists.

**Weighting Rules (applied during evaluation):**
1. **Recency Priority**: Last 24 months matter most. Historical reputation does not excuse recent failures.
1. **Verification**: Fact-checker findings are strong reliability signals.
1. **Visibility Cap**: Score capped by worst high-visibility failures.
1. **Opinion Counts**: Misinformation in opinion/editorial degrades entire source score.
1. **Bias Impact**: Bias affecting accuracy lowers score. Bias without factual issues is noted, not penalized.

**Bias Assessment:**
* Political spectrum: far_left / left / center_left / center / center_right / right / far_right
* Other bias types: pro_government / anti_government / corporate_interest / sensationalist / ideological_other

**Insufficient Data:**
* Sources with no independent assessments return ##score: null## with ##factualRating: insufficient_data##

**Impact on verdicts:**
* Score >= 0.58: Preserves original verdict (credible source)
* Score 0.43-0.57: Moderate pull toward neutral (mixed track record)
* Score < 0.43: Strong pull toward neutral (skepticism)
