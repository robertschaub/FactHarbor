{{info}}
This page describes **planned production capabilities** that are not yet implemented. The current system runs as a two-service application (Next.js + .NET API) with SQLite. See [[Architecture>>FactHarbor.Product Development.Specification.Architecture.WebHome]] for the current design.

== Roadmap Overview ==

{{include reference="FactHarbor.Product Development.Diagrams.Architecture Roadmap.WebHome"/}}

//Green = current POC. Yellow = Alpha (next). Orange = Beta. Blue = V1.0. Purple = V2.0+. Each phase builds on the previous.//

== Planned Automated Systems ==

=== Background Jobs (Alpha) ===

|= System |= Schedule |= Purpose
| Source Track Record Updates | Scheduled batch | Analyze claim outcomes, update source accuracy
| Cache Management | Continuous | Warm cache, invalidate on updates, monitor hit rates
| Metrics Aggregation | Recurring | Roll up detailed metrics, calculate health indicators
| Data Archival | Scheduled | Move old logs to S3 (90+ days), compress backups

=== Quality Monitoring (Beta) ===

|= Check |= Description
| Anomaly Detection | Flag unusual patterns in confidence scores, evidence distributions
| Contradiction Detection | Identify evidence conflicts, internal claim contradictions
| Completeness Validation | Ensure sufficient evidence, multiple source types

=== Moderation Detection (Beta) ===

|= Check |= Description
| Spam Identification | Pattern matching for spam claims
| Manipulation Detection | Identify coordinated editing
| Gaming Detection | Flag attempts to game source scores
| Suspicious Activity | Log unusual behavior patterns

== Scalability Strategy ==

=== Horizontal Scaling ===

|= Component |= Scaling Approach
| AKEL Workers | Add more processing workers as claim volume grows
| Database Read Replicas | Add replicas for read-heavy workloads
| Cache Layer | Redis cluster for distributed caching
| API Servers | Load-balanced stateless instances

=== Performance Optimization ===

|= Optimization |= Expected Impact
| Denormalized data | Cache summary data in claim records (70% fewer joins)
| Parallel processing | AKEL pipeline processes in parallel (40% faster)
| Intelligent caching | Redis caches frequently accessed data
| Background processing | Non-urgent tasks run asynchronously

== Monitoring and Observability ==

=== Key Metrics ===

|= Category |= Metrics
| **Performance** | AKEL processing time, API response time, cache hit rate
| **Quality** | Confidence score distribution, evidence completeness, contradiction rate
| **Usage** | Claims per day, active users, API requests
| **Errors** | Failed AKEL runs, API errors, database issues

=== Alert Thresholds ===

|= Condition |= Alert Level
| Processing time > 30 seconds | Warning
| Error rate > 1% | Critical
| Cache hit rate < 80% | Warning
| Database connections > 80% capacity | Critical

=== Monitoring Stack ===

|= Capability |= Technology |= Phase
| Metrics collection | Prometheus | Beta
| Dashboards | Grafana | Beta
| Alerting | Prometheus Alertmanager | Beta
| Distributed tracing | OpenTelemetry | V1.0
| Log aggregation | ELK or Loki | V1.0

== Security Roadmap ==

|= Capability |= Phase |= Description
| User authentication | Alpha | Secure login with password hashing
| RBAC | Alpha | Reader, User, Admin, Moderator roles
| Rate limiting | Alpha | Per-user and per-IP throttling
| SSRF protection | Alpha | Sanitize URLs before fetching
| CORS tightening | Alpha | Restrict allowed origins
| Audit logging | Beta | Track all significant changes
| API keys | Beta | Programmatic access tokens
| Abuse prevention | Beta | Automated detection and ban mechanisms

== Deployment Evolution ==

=== Production Environment (Beta+) ===

|= Component |= Technology
| Load Balancer | HAProxy or cloud LB
| API Servers | Multiple stateless instances
| AKEL Workers | Auto-scaling pool
| Primary Database | PostgreSQL
| Read Replicas | PostgreSQL streaming replication
| Cache | Redis cluster
| Object Storage | S3-compatible

=== Disaster Recovery ===

|= Aspect |= Current (POC) |= Target (Production)
| **Backups** | Manual SQLite file copy | Automated PostgreSQL backups to S3
| **Recovery** | Restore SQLite files | Point-in-time recovery from transaction logs
| **Replication** | None (single instance) | PostgreSQL streaming replication
| **RTO** | Manual (hours) | < 4 hours
| **Data loss window** | Since last backup | Minutes (WAL-based)

== When to Add Complexity ==

Each technology addition has a specific trigger — do not add prematurely:

|= Technology |= Trigger |= Current Status
| **PostgreSQL** | Multiple users / shared state needed | Planned (Alpha)
| **Redis** | Multi-instance deployment needed | Planned (Beta)
| **Elasticsearch** | PostgreSQL search consistently > 500ms | Not needed yet
| **TimescaleDB** | Metrics queries consistently > 1s | Not needed yet
| **Vector DB** | Semantic search / RAG features needed | Not needed yet
| **Federation** | 10,000+ users and explicit demand | Deferred (V2.0+)

== Federation (V2.0+) ==

**Deferred until**:
* Core product proven with 10,000+ users
* User demand for decentralization
* Single-node limits reached

Federation would enable:
* Distributed fact-checking across independent instances
* Cross-instance verdict sharing and consensus
* Regional deployment for data sovereignty
