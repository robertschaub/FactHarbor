= Data Model =

FactHarbor's data model centres on the **analysis result** — a structured representation of how claims are decomposed, researched, and evaluated. This page defines the complete entity landscape derived from the source code, the 7-point verdict scale, and the job lifecycle.

== Entity Overview ==

The following diagram shows all major entity groups and their primary relationships at a glance. For detailed views (result fields, target database, runtime entities, UI visibility), see [[Entity Views>>FactHarbor.Product Development.Diagrams.Entity Views.WebHome]].

{{include reference="FactHarbor.Product Development.Diagrams.Entity Views.WebHome" section="HOverviewERD"/}}

== Analysis Entity Model ==

The core analysis pipeline produces a hierarchy of entities: the input is decomposed into contexts, factors, and claims (Step 1), evidence is gathered from web sources (Step 2), and verdicts are generated per-claim and aggregated per-context into an overall article analysis (Steps 3-5).

{{include reference="FactHarbor.Product Development.Diagrams.Analysis Entity Model ERD.WebHome"/}}

== Entity Descriptions ==

|= Entity |= Purpose |= Source Interface |= Key Relationships
| **ClaimUnderstanding** | Step 1 output: decomposition of input into structured claims, contexts, and factors | ##types.ts:335## | Parent of AnalysisContext[], KeyFactor[], SubClaim[]
| **AnalysisContext** | Bounded analytical frame for multi-perspective topics (e.g., "legal proceedings" vs. "public health") | ##types.ts:188## | Referenced by SubClaim, ClaimVerdict, EvidenceItem, ContextAnswer
| **KeyFactor** | Evaluation dimension — a question that must be answered to verify the thesis (e.g., "Was due process followed?") | ##types.ts:271## | Referenced by SubClaim, ClaimVerdict; aggregated in ContextAnswer
| **SubClaim** | Atomic verifiable assertion decomposed from input; mapped to a context and factor | ##types.ts:335## (embedded) | Links to AnalysisContext, KeyFactor; becomes a ClaimVerdict
| **ClaimVerdict** | Per-claim verdict with truth percentage, confidence, reasoning, and evidence references | ##types.ts:475## | References EvidenceItem[], AnalysisContext, KeyFactor
| **EvidenceItem** | Extracted statement from a web source with quality metadata (probative value, authority, basis) | ##types.ts:410## | References FetchedSource, AnalysisContext
| **FetchedSource** | Web source with URL, content, and source reliability score (0.0-1.0 from LLM evaluation) | ##types.ts:457## | Referenced by EvidenceItem[]
| **ContextAnswer** | Per-context verdict aggregating claim verdicts and KeyFactor assessments within one analytical frame | ##types.ts:293## | References AnalysisContext; contains KeyFactor verdicts
| **ArticleAnalysis** | Overall analysis summary: article-level verdict, claim pattern distribution, pseudoscience detection | ##types.ts:526## | Aggregates ClaimVerdict[], ContextAnswer[]

=== Additional Entities ===

* **EvidenceScope** (##types.ts:237##) — Per-evidence methodology metadata (methodology, boundaries, geographic scope, temporal scope). Embedded in EvidenceItem.
* **ResearchState** (##types.ts:321##) — Top-level research container holding ClaimUnderstanding, EvidenceItem[], FetchedSource[], SearchQuery[], and iteration history.
* **FactorAnalysis** (##types.ts:281##) — Aggregation metrics for KeyFactor verdicts: positive/negative/neutral/contested factor counts.

== Quality Gate Entities ==

Two quality gates produce validation entities that attach to the analysis result.

|= Entity |= Gate |= Purpose |= Key Fields |= Source
| **ClaimValidationResult** | Gate 1 | Per-claim factuality check | ##isFactual##, ##opinionScore##, ##specificityScore##, ##claimType## | ##types.ts:66##
| **VerdictValidationResult** | Gate 4 | Per-verdict confidence assessment | ##evidenceCount##, ##averageSourceQuality##, ##evidenceAgreement##, ##confidenceTier## | ##types.ts:82##
| **QualityGates** | Both | Aggregate pass/fail with Gate1Stats and Gate4Stats | ##passed##, ##gate1Stats##, ##gate4Stats## | ##types.ts:133##

For detailed quality gate criteria and examples, see [[Quality Gates Deep Dive>>FactHarbor.Product Development.Specification.Architecture.Deep Dive.Quality Gates.WebHome]].

== Configuration Entities ==

Four configuration profiles are stored as immutable JSON blobs in the UCM (Unified Config Management) system. Each analysis job records the exact config snapshot used for reproducibility.

|= Config |= Purpose |= Key Settings |= Source
| **PipelineConfig** | Pipeline operational settings | LLM provider selection, model tiering, budget controls, context detection, confidence calibration | ##config-schemas.ts:86##
| **CalcConfig** | Calculation and aggregation | Verdict bands, centrality weights, contestation penalties, quality gate thresholds, deduplication | ##config-schemas.ts:751##
| **SearchConfig** | Search provider settings | Provider selection, max results, timeout, domain whitelist/blacklist | ##config-schemas.ts:52##
| **SourceReliabilityConfig** | Source reliability service | Multi-model consensus, confidence/consensus thresholds, cache TTL, platform skip lists | ##config-schemas.ts:598##

For configuration storage and versioning, see [[Storage and Configuration>>FactHarbor.Product Development.Specification.Architecture.Storage and Configuration.WebHome]].

== 7-Point Verdict Scale ==

{{include reference="FactHarbor.Product Development.Diagrams.Verdict Scale.WebHome"/}}

//The 7-point verdict scale maps truth percentages to verdict labels. MIXED (evidence on both sides, confidence >= 60%) and UNVERIFIED (insufficient evidence, confidence < 60%) share the same percentage range but differ in their confidence interpretation.//

|= Verdict |= Truth % Range |= Meaning
| **TRUE** | 86-100% | Claim is well-supported by strong evidence
| **MOSTLY TRUE** | 72-85% | Claim is largely supported with minor caveats
| **LEANING TRUE** | 58-71% | More evidence supports than contradicts, but not conclusive
| **MIXED** | 43-57% (confidence >= 60%) | Significant evidence on both sides
| **UNVERIFIED** | 43-57% (confidence < 60%) | Insufficient evidence to determine truth
| **LEANING FALSE** | 29-42% | More evidence contradicts than supports
| **MOSTLY FALSE** | 15-28% | Claim is largely contradicted by evidence
| **FALSE** | 0-14% | Claim is strongly contradicted by evidence

=== MIXED vs. UNVERIFIED ===

Both occupy the 43-57% truth range. The distinction is **confidence-based**:
* **MIXED**: The system found substantial evidence but it points in opposing directions (high confidence in the conflict)
* **UNVERIFIED**: The system could not find enough evidence to make a determination (low confidence due to insufficient data)

== Job Lifecycle ==

{{include reference="FactHarbor.Product Development.Diagrams.Job Lifecycle ERD.WebHome"/}}

=== Job Status Transitions ===

|= Status |= Meaning
| **QUEUED** | Job submitted, waiting for runner capacity
| **RUNNING** | AKEL pipeline is executing
| **SUCCEEDED** | Analysis complete, results available
| **FAILED** | Analysis failed (provider error, timeout, or input issue)
| **PAUSED** | System auto-paused due to provider outage (jobs resume when system recovers)

== Audit Trail ==

{{include reference="FactHarbor.Product Development.Diagrams.Audit Trail ERD.WebHome"/}}

== Storage ==

Analysis results are currently stored as **JSON blobs** in SQLite (via the .NET Entity Framework ##ResultJson## field). The full entity model above lives within this JSON blob — it is not normalised into separate database tables.

|= Database |= Technology |= Contents
| ##factharbor.db## | .NET Entity Framework Core | Jobs, events, analysis results (JSON), metrics
| ##config.db## | Next.js better-sqlite3 | UCM configuration blobs, activation pointers, usage tracking
| ##source-reliability.db## | Next.js better-sqlite3 | Source credibility evaluation cache

**Target Evolution:** PostgreSQL for primary storage (enabling full-text search, user accounts), with the JSON blob approach preserved for backwards compatibility during migration. See [[Storage and Configuration>>FactHarbor.Product Development.Specification.Architecture.Storage and Configuration.WebHome]] for details, and [[Target Data Model>>FactHarbor.Product Development.Specification.Data Model.WebHome]] for the normalised design specification.

== Deep Dives ==

* [[Calculations and Verdicts>>FactHarbor.Product Development.Specification.Architecture.Deep Dive.Calculations and Verdicts.WebHome]] — Verdict calculation formulas, aggregation hierarchy, weighting factors
* [[Confidence Calibration>>FactHarbor.Product Development.Specification.Architecture.Deep Dive.Confidence Calibration.WebHome]] — 4-layer confidence system, penalty calculations
* [[KeyFactors Design>>FactHarbor.Product Development.Specification.Architecture.Deep Dive.KeyFactors Design.WebHome]] — KeyFactor design decisions, contestation structure, conceptual target ERD
