This document describes the **Specification** of FactHarbor. It is a working draft. See [[Project Status>>FactHarbor.Product Development.Planning.Project Status.WebHome]] for current development phase.

= Specification =

This section defines the functional specification and technical architecture of FactHarbor. See also [[Requirements>>FactHarbor.Product Development.Requirements.WebHome]] (sibling section).

== 1. Mission ==

**FactHarbor brings clarity and transparency to a world full of unclear, controversial, and misleading information by shedding light on the context, assumptions, and evidence behind claims — empowering people to better understand and judge wisely.**

== 2. Purpose ==

Modern society faces a deep informational crisis:

* Misinformation spreads faster than corrections.
* High-quality evidence is buried under noise.
* Meanings shift depending on context — but this is rarely made explicit.
* Users lack tools to understand *why* information conflicts.
* Claims are evaluated without clearly defined assumptions.

FactHarbor introduces structure, transparency, and evidence-based reasoning. It provides:

* Automated claim extraction and evidence research.
* Multiple analytical perspectives (AnalysisContexts) for ambiguous claims.
* Transparent assumptions, definitions, and boundaries.
* Full evidence provenance — every verdict traceable to sources.
* Structured verdicts on a 7-point evidence scale (well-supported → refuted).
* Immutable analysis outputs — quality improves through system improvements, not data edits.

== 3. Core Concepts ==

* **Claim**: A statement needing structured verification.
* **AnalysisContext**: A bounded analytical frame (legal, methodological, temporal) requiring a separate verdict.
* **KeyFactor**: A decomposition question that breaks a claim into verifiable dimensions.
* **EvidenceItem**: A piece of evidence extracted from a source, with provenance and reliability scoring.
* **Verdict**: An evidence-based rating on a 7-point scale, per claim and per AnalysisContext.
* **AKEL**: The AI Knowledge Extraction Layer — FactHarbor's automated analysis engine.
* **UCM**: Unified Configuration Management — versioned system configuration that controls analysis behaviour.
* **Content States**: Published (passed quality gates, visible to all) or Hidden (moderated due to policy violations).

== 4. How It Works ==

{{include reference="FactHarbor.Product Development.Diagrams.Claim and Scenario Lifecycle (Overview).WebHome"/}}

FactHarbor follows an automated analysis lifecycle:

1. **Submission** — User submits a URL or text. Claims are automatically extracted and normalised.
2. **Analysis** — AKEL researches evidence from the web, evaluates source reliability, and generates structured verdicts.
3. **Quality gates** — Automated gates validate claims (Gate 1) and assess verdict confidence (Gate 4).
4. **Publication** — Results that pass quality gates are published with confidence scores, source quality indicators, and clear AI-generated labeling.
5. **System improvement** — Quality improves through system changes (code, prompts, configuration) — analysis data is immutable.

//No human review of individual analyses. Improve the system, not the data.//

== 5. Reading Guide ==

This specification is organised from conceptual overview to implementation detail.
