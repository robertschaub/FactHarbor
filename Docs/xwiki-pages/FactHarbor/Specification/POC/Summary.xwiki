== 1. POC Specification ==

=== POC Goal
Prove that AI can extract claims and determine verdicts automatically without human intervention.

=== POC Output (4 Components Only)

**1. ANALYSIS SUMMARY**
- 3-5 sentences
- How many claims found
- Distribution of verdicts 
- Overall assessment

**2. CLAIMS IDENTIFICATION**
- 3-5 numbered factual claims
- Extracted automatically by AI

**3. CLAIMS VERDICTS**
- Per claim: Verdict label + Confidence % + Brief reasoning (1-3 sentences)
- Verdict labels: WELL-SUPPORTED / PARTIALLY SUPPORTED / UNCERTAIN / REFUTED

**4. ARTICLE SUMMARY (optional)**
- 3-5 sentences
- Neutral summary of article content

**Total output: ~200-300 words**

=== What's NOT in POC

❌ Scenarios (multiple interpretations) 
❌ Evidence display (supporting/opposing lists) 
❌ Source links 
❌ Detailed reasoning chains 
❌ User accounts, history, search 
❌ Browser extensions, API 
❌ Accessibility, multilingual, mobile 
❌ Export, sharing features 
❌ Any other features

=== Critical Requirement

**FULLY AUTOMATED - NO MANUAL EDITING**

This is non-negotiable. POC tests whether AI can do this without human intervention.

=== POC Success Criteria

**Passes if:**
- ✅ AI extracts 3-5 factual claims automatically
- ✅ AI provides reasonable verdicts (≥70% make sense)
- ✅ Output is comprehensible
- ✅ Team agrees approach has merit
- ✅ Minimal or no manual editing needed

**Fails if:**
- ❌ Claim extraction poor (< 60% accuracy)
- ❌ Verdicts nonsensical (< 60% reasonable)
- ❌ Requires manual editing for most analyses (> 50%)
- ❌ Team loses confidence in approach

=== POC Architecture

**Frontend:** Simple input form + results display 
**Backend:** Single API call to Claude (Sonnet 4.5) 
**Processing:** One prompt generates complete analysis 
**Database:** None required (stateless)

=== POC Philosophy

> "Build less, learn more, decide faster. Test the hardest part first."

=== Context-Aware Analysis (Experimental POC1 Feature) ===

**Problem:** Article credibility ≠ simple average of claim verdicts

**Example:** Article with accurate facts (coffee has antioxidants, antioxidants fight cancer) but false conclusion (therefore coffee cures cancer) would score as "mostly accurate" with simple averaging, but is actually MISLEADING.

**Solution (POC1 Test):** Approach 1 - Single-Pass Holistic Analysis
* Enhanced AI prompt to evaluate logical structure
* AI identifies main argument and assesses if it follows from evidence
* Article verdict may differ from claim average
* Zero additional cost, no architecture changes

**Testing:**
* 30-article test set
* Success: ≥70% accuracy detecting misleading articles
* Marked as experimental

**See:** [[Article Verdict Problem>>FactHarbor.Specification.POC.Article-Verdict-Problem]] for full analysis and solution approaches.

== 2. POC2 Specification ==

=== POC2 Goal ===
Prove that AKEL produces high-quality outputs consistently at scale with complete quality validation.

=== POC2 Enhancements (From POC1) ===

**1. COMPLETE QUALITY GATES (All 4)**
* Gate 1: Claim Validation (from POC1)
* Gate 2: Evidence Relevance ← NEW
* Gate 3: Scenario Coherence ← NEW 
* Gate 4: Verdict Confidence (from POC1)

**2. EVIDENCE DEDUPLICATION (FR54)**
* Prevent counting same source multiple times
* Handle syndicated content (AP, Reuters)
* Content fingerprinting with fuzzy matching
* Target: >95% duplicate detection accuracy

**3. CONTEXT-AWARE ANALYSIS (Conditional)**
* **If POC1 succeeds (≥70%):** Implement as standard feature
* **If POC1 promising (50-70%):** Try weighted aggregation approach
* **If POC1 fails (<50%):** Defer to post-POC2
* Detects articles with accurate claims but misleading conclusions

**4. QUALITY METRICS DASHBOARD (NFR13)**
* Track hallucination rates
* Monitor gate performance
* Evidence quality metrics
* Processing statistics

=== What's Still NOT in POC2 ===

❌ User accounts, authentication 
❌ Public publishing interface 
❌ Social sharing features 
❌ Full production security (comes in Beta 0) 
❌ In-article claim highlighting (comes in Beta 0)

=== Success Criteria ===

**Quality:**
* Hallucination rate <5% (target: <3%)
* Average quality rating ≥8.0/10
* Gates identify >95% of low-quality outputs

**Performance:**
* All 4 quality gates operational
* Evidence deduplication >95% accurate
* Quality metrics tracked continuously

**Context-Aware (if implemented):**
* Maintains ≥70% accuracy detecting misleading articles
* <15% false positive rate

**Total Output Size:** Similar to POC1 (~220-350 words per analysis)

== 2. Key Strategic Recommendations

=== Immediate Actions

**For POC:**
1. Focus on core functionality only (claims + verdicts)
2. Create basic explainer (1 page)
3. Test AI quality without manual editing
4. Make GO/NO-GO decision

**Planning:**
1. Define accessibility strategy (when to build)
2. Decide on multilingual priorities (which languages first)
3. Research media verification options (partner vs build)
4. Evaluate browser extension approach

=== Testing Strategy

**POC Tests:** Can AI do this without humans? 
**Beta Tests:** What do users need? What works? What doesn't? 
**Release Tests:** Is it production-ready?

**Key Principle:** Test assumptions before building features.

=== Build Sequence (Priority Order)

**Must Build:**
1. Core analysis (claims + verdicts) ← POC
2. Educational resources (basic → comprehensive)
3. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) ← Legal requirement

**Should Build (Validate First):**
4. Browser extensions ← Test demand
5. Media verification ← Pilot with existing tools
6. Multilingual ← Start with 2-3 languages

**Can Build Later:**
7. Mobile apps ← PWA first
8. ClaimReview schema ← After content library
9. Export features ← Based on user requests
10. Everything else ← Based on validation

=== Decision Framework

**For each feature, ask:**
1. **Importance:** Risk + Impact + Strategy alignment?
2. **Urgency:** Fail fast + Legal + Promises?
3. **Validation:** Do we know users want this?
4. **Priority:** When should we build it?

**Don't build anything without answering these questions.**

== 4. Critical Principles

=== Automation First
- AI makes content decisions
- Humans improve algorithms
- Scale through code, not people

=== Fail Fast
- Test assumptions quickly
- Don't build unvalidated features
- Accept that experiments may fail
- Learn from failures

=== Evidence Over Authority
- Transparent reasoning visible
- No single "true/false" verdicts
- Multiple scenarios shown
- Assumptions made explicit

=== User Focus
- Serve users' needs first
- Build what's actually useful
- Don't build what's just "cool"
- Measure and iterate

=== Honest Assessment
- Don't cherry-pick examples
- Document failures openly
- Accept limitations
- No overpromising

== 5. POC Decision Gate

=== After POC, Choose:

**GO (Proceed to Beta):**
- AI quality ≥70% without editing
- Approach validated
- Team confident
- Clear path to improvement

**NO-GO (Pivot or Stop):**
- AI quality < 60%
- Requires manual editing for most
- Fundamental flaws identified
- Not feasible with current technology

**ITERATE (Improve & Retry):**
- Concept has merit
- Specific improvements identified
- Addressable with better prompts
- Test again after changes

== 6. Key Risks & Mitigations

=== Risk 1: AI Quality Not Good Enough
**Mitigation:** Extensive prompt testing, use best models 
**Acceptance:** POC might fail - that's what testing reveals

=== Risk 2: Users Don't Understand Output
**Mitigation:** Create clear explainer, test with real users 
**Acceptance:** Iterate on explanation until comprehensible

=== Risk 3: Approach Doesn't Scale
**Mitigation:** Start simple, add complexity only when proven 
**Acceptance:** POC proves concept, beta proves scale

=== Risk 4: Legal/Compliance Issues
**Mitigation:** Plan accessibility early, consult legal experts 
**Acceptance:** Can't launch publicly without compliance

=== Risk 5: Feature Creep
**Mitigation:** Strict scope discipline, say NO to additions 
**Acceptance:** POC is minimal by design

== 7. Success Metrics

=== POC Success
- AI output quality ≥70%
- Manual editing needed < 30% of time
- Team confidence: High
- Decision: GO to beta

=== Platform Success (Later)
- User comprehension ≥80%
- Return user rate ≥30%

== 9. Core Philosophy

**Three Pillars:**

**1. Scenarios Over Verdicts**
- Show multiple interpretations
- Make context explicit
- Acknowledge uncertainty
- Avoid false certainty

**2. Transparency Over Authority**
- Show reasoning, not just conclusions
- Make assumptions explicit
- Link to evidence
- Enable verification

**3. Evidence Over Opinions**
- Ground claims in sources
- Show supporting AND opposing evidence
- Evaluate source quality
- Avoid cherry-picking
