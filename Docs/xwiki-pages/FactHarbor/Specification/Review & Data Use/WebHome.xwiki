= Review & Data Use =
This page describes the Review & Data Use model, defining User roles and how review actions are logged.
== 1. User & Role Concepts ==
* **USER**: Base entity for all users (human or technical).
* **TECHNICAL_USER**: Strictly technical identities (services, federation components, background jobs).
* **CONTRIBUTING_USER**: Users that can contribute content (claims, scenarios, evidence).
** **TRUSTED_CONTRIBUTOR**: Additional trust / certification properties.
** **REVIEWER**: Can perform review actions on versioned entities.
** **EXPERT**: Contributor with domain‑specific expertise / higher authority.
* **FEDERATION_NODE**: Technical entity representing a participating node in the federation.
* **FEDERATION_ADMIN**: Administers one or more federation nodes; not necessarily a content contributor.
== 2. Review Actions ==
The system logs every significant action:
* **REVIEW_ACTION** logs *who* did *what* on *which* versioned entity.
* Fields: ``ReviewActionID``, ``UserID``, ``EntityType``, ``EntityVersionID``, ``ActionType``, ``Timestamp``.
* Each entry targets a specific **VERSIONED** entity (e.g., ClaimVersion, ScenarioVersion).
* **Claim Clusters** may also be targets of review actions (e.g., curation or moderation).
