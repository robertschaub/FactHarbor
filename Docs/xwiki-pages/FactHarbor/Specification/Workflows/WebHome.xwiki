FactHarbor workflows are **simple, automated, focused on continuous improvement**.
== 1. Core Principles ==
* **Automated by default**: AI processes everything
* **Publish immediately**: No centralized approval (removed in V0.9.50)
* **Quality through monitoring**: Not gatekeeping
* **Fix systems, not data**: Errors trigger improvements
* **Human-in-loop**: Only for edge cases and abuse
== 2. Claim Submission Workflow ==

=== 2.1 Claim Extraction ===

When users submit content (text, articles, web pages), FactHarbor first extracts individual verifiable claims:

**Input Types:**
* Single claim: "The Earth is flat"
* Text with multiple claims: "Climate change is accelerating. Sea levels rose 3mm in 2023. Arctic ice decreased 13% annually."
* URLs: Web pages analyzed for factual claims

**Extraction Process:**
* LLM analyzes submitted content
* Identifies distinct, verifiable factual claims
* Separates claims from opinions, questions, or commentary
* Each claim becomes independent for processing

**Output:**
* List of claims with context
* Each claim assigned unique ID
* Original context preserved for reference

This extraction ensures:
* Each claim receives focused analysis
* Multiple claims in one submission are all processed
* Claims are properly isolated for independent verification
* Context is preserved for accurate interpretation

```
User submits → Duplicate detection → Categorization → Processing queue → User receives ID
```
**Timeline**: Seconds
**No approval needed**

== 2.5 Claim and Scenario Workflow ==

== 3. Automated Analysis Workflow ==
```
Claim from queue
↓
Evidence gathering (AKEL)
↓
Source evaluation (track record check)
↓
Scenario generation
↓
Verdict synthesis
↓
Risk assessment
↓
Quality gates (confidence > 40%? risk < 80%?)
↓
Publish OR Flag for improvement
```
**Timeline**: 10-30 seconds
**90%+ published automatically**
== 3.5 Evidence and Verdict Workflow ==
{{include reference="FactHarbor.Specification.Diagrams.Evidence and Verdict Workflow.WebHome"/}}
== 4. Publication Workflow ==
**Standard (90%+)**: Pass quality gates → Publish immediately with confidence scores
**High Risk (<10%)**: Risk > 80% → Moderator review
**Low Quality**: Confidence < 40% → Improvement queue → Re-process
== 5. User Contribution Workflow ==
```
Contributor edits → System validates → Applied immediately → Logged → Reputation earned
```
**No approval required** (Wikipedia model)
**New contributors** (<50 reputation): Limited to minor edits
== 5.5 Quality and Audit Workflow ==

{{include reference="FactHarbor.Specification.Diagrams.Quality and Audit Workflow.WebHome"/}}

== 6. Flagging Workflow ==
```
User flags issue → Categorize (abuse/quality) → Automated or manual resolution
```
**Quality issues**: Add to improvement queue → System fix → Auto re-process
**Abuse**: Moderator review → Action taken
== 7. Moderation Workflow ==
**Automated pre-moderation**: 95% published automatically
**Moderator queue**: Only high-risk or flagged content
**Appeal process**: Different moderator → Governing Team if needed
== 8. System Improvement Workflow ==
**Weekly cycle**:
```
Monday: Review error patterns
Tuesday-Wednesday: Develop fixes
Thursday: Test improvements
Friday: Deploy & re-process
Weekend: Monitor metrics
```
**Error capture**:
```
Error detected → Categorize → Root cause → Improvement queue → Pattern analysis
```
**A/B Testing**:
```
New algorithm → Split traffic (90% control, 10% test) → Run 1 week → Compare metrics → Deploy if better
```
== 9. Quality Monitoring Workflow ==
**Continuous**: Every hour calculate metrics, detect anomalies
**Daily**: Update source track records, aggregate error patterns
**Weekly**: System improvement cycle, performance review
== 10. Source Track Record Workflow ==
**Initial score**: New source starts at 50 (neutral)
**Daily updates**: Calculate accuracy, correction frequency, update score
**Continuous**: All claims using source recalculated when score changes
== 11. Re-Processing Workflow ==
**Triggers**: System improvement deployed, source score updated, new evidence, error fixed
**Process**: Identify affected claims → Re-run AKEL → Compare → Update if better → Log change
