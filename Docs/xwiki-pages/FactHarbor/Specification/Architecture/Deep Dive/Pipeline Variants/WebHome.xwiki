**Developer Reference** — Twin-path pipeline architecture: the two selectable analysis variants, their shared primitives, invariants, result model, and configuration.

**Key Files**: ##orchestrated.ts##, ##monolithic-dynamic.ts##
{{/info}}

== Architecture Overview ==

FactHarbor supports two analysis pipeline variants. Both share the same infrastructure primitives but differ in orchestration approach and result flexibility.

//Green = production-ready, Red = experimental. Both variants converge on a common result envelope for auditability.//

== Non-Negotiable Invariants ==

Both variants must preserve these architectural invariants:

|= Invariant |= Requirement
| **Pipeline integrity** | Understand → Research → Verdict (no stage skipping)
| **Input neutrality** | Question vs. statement divergence target <= 4 points (avg absolute)
| **Context detection** | Multi-context detection with unified "Context" terminology
| **Quality gates** | Gate 1 (claim validation) and Gate 4 (confidence) are mandatory
| **Generic by design** | No domain-specific hardcoding or keyword lists
| **No synthetic evidence** | Evidence must be attributable to fetched sources with real URLs + excerpts
| **Fail closed** | Missing/invalid provenance degrades confidence or triggers fallback — never hallucinate

== Variant Comparison ==

|= Criterion |= Orchestrated |= Monolithic Dynamic
| **Maturity** | Production-ready | Experimental
| **Result Schema** | Canonical (stable) | Dynamic (flexible)
| **UI Compatibility** | Full support | Separate viewer needed
| **Quality Gates** | Gate 1 + Gate 4 | Minimum safety contract
| **Pipeline Stages** | Fixed AKEL | LLM tool-loop
| **Provenance** | Strict | Minimum requirements
| **Budget Control** | Iterations / sources | maxSteps / sources
| **Cost Predictability** | High | Low
| **Typical Latency** | 2-5 min | 1-4 min
| **Use Case** | Production | Format experimentation

== Shared Primitives ==

Both variants reuse stable infrastructure primitives. Orchestration logic stays isolated per variant to prevent cross-contamination.

=== What Is Shared ===

//Shared primitives and analyzer modules are used by both pipelines. Orchestration logic is isolated per variant — no cross-calls between implementations.//

=== What Is Kept Separate ===

* Orchestrated pipeline orchestration logic (##orchestrated.ts##)
* Dynamic monolithic tool-loop orchestration logic (##monolithic-dynamic.ts##)

=== Text Analysis Service (v2.9+) ===

LLM-only text analysis (no heuristic fallback), shared by both pipelines:

|= Analysis Point |= Pipeline Phase |= Purpose
| Input Classification | Understand | Decompose claims, detect comparative/compound
| Evidence Quality | Research | Filter low-quality evidence, assess probative value
| Context Similarity | Organize | Merge similar contexts, infer phase buckets
| Verdict Validation | Aggregate | Detect inversions, harm potential, contestation

== Result Model ==

=== Common Result Envelope ===

Every job result includes a common envelope regardless of variant:

|= Field |= Type |= Description
| ##pipelineVariant## | string | ##"orchestrated"## / ##"monolithic_dynamic"##
| ##pipelineVersion## | string | Schema version / build info
| ##budgets## | object | Configured caps (iterations, maxSteps, maxSources, tokens)
| ##budgetStats## | object | Observed usage
| ##warnings## | array | Fallback events, provenance rejections
| ##providerInfo## | object | Model and provider identifiers used

=== Canonical Payload ===

Used by ##orchestrated##. Must match the entity model that the existing Jobs UI expects: claims, claim verdicts, article verdict, evidence items, sources.

=== Dynamic Payload (Minimum Safety Contract) ===

Used by ##monolithic_dynamic##. Allows flexible structure but requires:

|= Field |= Required |= Description
| ##rawJson## | Yes | The model's full JSON output
| ##citations## | Yes | Array with ##url## (HTTP(S)), ##excerpt## (non-trivial), ##title## (optional)
| ##narrativeMarkdown## | No | Human-readable explanation
| ##toolTrace## | No | Tool-call trace (queries, fetched URLs, timestamps)

== Configuration ==

=== Pipeline Selection (UCM) ===

{{code language="json"}}
{
  "defaultPipelineVariant": "orchestrated",
  "allowedVariants": [
    "orchestrated",
    "monolithic_dynamic"
  ]
}
{{/code}}

=== Per-Job Override (API) ===

{{code language="json"}}
POST /api/fh/jobs
{
  "inputType": "text",
  "inputValue": "...",
  "pipelineVariant": "orchestrated"
}
{{/code}}

The selected variant is **persisted on the job at creation time**, ensuring reproducibility even if defaults change later.

== Fallback Behavior ==

|= Variant |= Trigger |= Action
| **Monolithic Dynamic** | Citation missing | Reject result, require minimum contract
| **Monolithic Dynamic** | Budget exceeded | Mark job as failed with budget stats
| **Monolithic Dynamic** | Timeout | Return partial results with warning

== Performance Characteristics ==

Typical analysis time for a 5-10 claim article:

|= Variant |= p50 |= p95 |= Est. Cost
| **Orchestrated** | 2-3 min | 5-7 min | $0.15-0.30
| **Monolithic Dynamic** | 1-2 min | 3-10 min | $0.10-0.50

== Risks and Mitigations ==

|= Risk |= Description |= Mitigation
| **Complexity creep** | Multiple variants can explode configuration and branching | Single dispatcher + strict shared-primitive boundary
| **Current-path regressions** | Refactoring shared primitives can change orchestrated behavior | Phase unifications behind thin wrappers; contract tests
| **Dynamic output safety** | Dynamic payload could omit evidence or mislead users | Minimum safety contract; UI labels as experimental
| **Cost/latency tail risk** | Uncontrolled tool loops cause runaway cost | maxSteps + maxSources + timeouts + budget enforcement
| **Security/abuse risk** | Users pick experimental path consuming more resources | Budget enforcement; optionally gate variants later

== Search Provider Requirements ==

Both pipelines use ##searchWebWithProvider()## and require at least one search provider:

|= Provider |= Environment Variables |= Notes
| **SerpAPI** | ##SERPAPI_API_KEY## | Pay-per-use (~$0.002/search)
| **Google CSE** | ##GOOGLE_CSE_API_KEY## + ##GOOGLE_CSE_ID## | Free tier: 100 queries/day

Without search credentials, analysis continues without external sources (LLM internal knowledge only if ##FH_ALLOW_MODEL_KNOWLEDGE=true##).
