== Level Descriptions ==

|= Level |= Name |= Key Features
| **Level 0** | POC/Demo (CURRENT) | All content auto-analyzed, AKEL generates verdicts, no risk tier filtering, single-user demo mode
| **Level 0.5** | Limited Production | Multi-user support, risk tier classification, basic sampling audit, algorithm improvement focus
| **Level 1.0** | Full Production | All tiers auto-published, clear risk labels, reduced sampling, mature algorithms
| **Level 2.0+** | Distributed | Federated multi-node, cross-node audits, advanced patterns, strategic sampling only

= Current Implementation (v2.6.33) =

|= Feature |= POC Target |= Actual Status
| AKEL auto-analysis | Yes | Implemented
| Verdict generation | Yes | Implemented (7-point scale)
| Quality Gates | Basic | Gates 1 and 4 implemented
| Risk tiers | Yes | Not implemented
| Sampling audits | High sampling | Not implemented
| User system | Demo only | Anonymous only

= Key Principles =

**Across All Levels:**
* AKEL makes all publication decisions
* No human approval gates
* Humans monitor metrics and improve algorithms
* Risk tiers guide audit priorities, not publication
* Sampling audits inform improvements
