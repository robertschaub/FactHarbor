**Current Implementation** — These examples use the current data model entities: ARTICLE, CLAIM, EVIDENCE_ITEM, SOURCE, ANALYSIS_CONTEXT, CLAIM_VERDICT, and ARTICLE_VERDICT. All data is stored as JSON in SQLite. See [[Core Data Model ERD>>FactHarbor.Specification.Diagrams.Core Data Model ERD.WebHome]] for the entity diagram and [[Evidence and Verdict Workflow>>FactHarbor.Specification.Diagrams.Evidence and Verdict Workflow.WebHome]] for the verdict generation flow.

**Note:** Examples include ##opposingEvidenceIds## (on CLAIM_VERDICT) and ##bias## (on SOURCE) which are planned Phase 2 fields not yet in the current code. The ##methodology## field on ANALYSIS_CONTEXT is stored within the ##metadata## JSON in the current implementation. Updated 2026-02-08 per documentation audit.

The following examples illustrate complete, realistic FactHarbor data objects across the current entity model. Each example shows the full pipeline output: from ARTICLE through CLAIMs, EVIDENCE_ITEMs, SOURCEs, ANALYSIS_CONTEXTs, to CLAIM_VERDICTs and the ARTICLE_VERDICT.

**Entity quick reference:**

|= Entity |= Purpose
| **ARTICLE** | Top-level analysis container (one per user submission)
| **CLAIM** | Extracted sub-claim with role, centrality, and context assignment
| **EVIDENCE_ITEM** | Individual evidence statement extracted from a source
| **SOURCE** | Fetched web source with reliability scoring
| **ANALYSIS_CONTEXT** | Bounded analytical frame requiring a separate verdict
| **CLAIM_VERDICT** | Per-claim verdict on the 7-point truth scale
| **ARTICLE_VERDICT** | Aggregated overall verdict for the article

(% style="width:100%" %)

| summary | ##Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are significantly less energy-efficient than battery EVs on a well-to-wheel basis. While individual component efficiencies vary, the cumulative losses in the hydrogen pathway (electrolysis ~65%, compression ~85-90%, fuel cell ~55%) result in 25-35% overall efficiency, compared to 70-80% for BEVs.##

== 8. Notes ==

* This example demonstrates **multi-context analysis**: the same claim evaluated under two different analytical frames (WTW and TTW) yields different sub-verdicts.
* The article-level verdict aggregates across contexts, weighted by centrality and evidence quality.
* The ##dependsOn## field on ##clm_04## shows claim dependency tracking — if ##clm_02## failed verification, ##clm_04## would be affected.

== 8. Notes ==

* This example shows **context-divergent verdicts**: immune context (LEANING-TRUE, 62%) vs mental context (MOSTLY-TRUE, 74%) produce different outcomes from the same broad claim.
* Gate 4 Confidence Assessment: immune context verdict is MEDIUM (65% confidence, 3 sources), mental context is MEDIUM (70% confidence, 2 sources).
* The ##criticism## category evidence (##ev_cw_02##) has a ##neutral## claimDirection — it questions methodology without directly contradicting the conclusion.

== 7. Notes ==

* The core claim receives UNVERIFIED with low confidence (35%) — below the 60% threshold that distinguishes MIXED from UNVERIFIED.
* Gate 4 Confidence Assessment: **INSUFFICIENT** (<2 sources directly addressing the core claim) — marked as DO NOT PUBLISH in a production context. However, the ##isCentral## flag means it is kept with caveats.
* AKEL decomposes the ambiguous input into two claims: the non-falsifiable core and a factual attribution claim. This demonstrates how claim decomposition can extract verifiable sub-claims from non-falsifiable inputs.

* Gate 4 Confidence Assessment: **INSUFFICIENT** (0 sources) — marked as DO NOT PUBLISH.
* Confidence is extremely low (15%) reflecting the absence of any evidence.
* In practice, AKEL still processes such inputs but produces a minimal result with clear labeling. The ##isCentral## flag ensures the core claim is always represented in output.

= AKEL Automation Summary =

Based on the current implementation (v2.10.2), the following summarizes what AKEL automates end-to-end versus what requires human involvement in future production modes.

== Fully Automated (current POC) ==

* Claim extraction and decomposition (text → sub-claims with roles and centrality)
* AnalysisContext detection (heuristic + LLM hybrid)
* KeyFactor discovery (decomposition questions per claim)
* Evidence extraction with source attribution and probative value scoring
* Source reliability scoring (LLM + Cache architecture)
* 7-layer evidence quality defense (provenance, tangential pruning, contestation validation)
* Verdict generation on 7-point truth scale with confidence scoring
* Quality gate enforcement (Gate 1: Claim Validation, Gate 4: Verdict Confidence)
* Contestation detection (doubted vs contested status)
* Harm potential assessment
* Full markdown report generation

== Requires Human Review (planned for Alpha/Production) ==

* High-risk tier claims (medical, legal, elections) — human review before publication
* Definition boundaries for ambiguous terms
* Ethical constraints on sensitive topics
* Final verdict approval for contested or high-risk claims
* Publication mode decisions (Draft-Only vs AI-Generated vs Human-Reviewed)
