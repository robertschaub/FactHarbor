= Roles & Publication Modes =

**Version:** 0.10.0
**Last Updated:** February 2026
**Status:** Current

This page defines user roles and publication modes in FactHarbor.

== 1. User Roles ==

=== 1.1 Readers (Guest) ===

**Who**: Anonymous visitors (no registration required)

**Can:**
* Browse and search published analyses
* View analysis results and evidence
* Read the Truth Landscape for any claim

**Cannot:**
* Submit URLs/text for analysis (requires login)
* Flag quality issues (requires login)
* Manage UCM configuration
* Moderate content

=== 1.2 Users (Registered) ===

**Who**: Logged-in users with a registered account

**Can:**
* Everything Readers can do
* Submit URLs/text for analysis (**rate-limited** — LLM and web search usage is not free)
* Flag quality issues
* View their own submission history

**Rate Limits:**
* Submission quotas per user per day/month (configurable via UCM)
* Prevents abuse and controls operational costs (LLM inference + web search API fees)

**Cannot:**
* Modify analysis output data (data is immutable)
* Manage UCM configuration
* Moderate content

=== 1.3 UCM Administrators ===

**Who**: Appointed by Governing Team to manage system configuration

**Responsibilities:**
* Manage UCM configuration (prompt templates, quality thresholds, model selection, source reliability rules)
* Monitor quality metrics and identify systematic improvement opportunities
* Version and activate configuration changes
* Trigger re-analysis when configuration improves
* Review UCM config audit trail

**Can:**
* Create and activate UCM config versions
* View config change history and audit trail
* Trigger re-analysis with updated config
* Access detailed system metrics
* Participate in RFC (Request for Comments) processes

**Cannot:**
* Edit individual analysis outputs (data is immutable)
* Override quality gates for specific analyses
* Act as editorial gatekeepers

**Key Principle**: UCM Administrators improve THE SYSTEM through configuration, not individual outputs.

=== 1.4 Moderators ===

**Who**: Team members focused on community health and abuse prevention

**Responsibilities:**
* Handle abuse, spam, and harassment
* Enforce community guidelines
* Respond to user reports
* Manage bans and appeals

**Can:**
* Hide abusive content
* Ban users for policy violations
* Review appeals
* Escalate serious issues to Governing Team

**Cannot:**
* Approve content for publication
* Review content quality before publication
* Override quality gates for content
* Act as editorial gatekeepers

**Critical Distinction:**
{{{
Moderators handle: ABUSE (spam, harassment, violations)
Moderators DO NOT handle: CONTENT QUALITY (that's automated)
}}}

=== 1.5 Domain Experts (Optional, Task-Specific) ===

**Who**: Subject matter specialists consulted for specific high-stakes disputes

**Not a permanent role**: Contacted externally when needed for contested claims in their domain

**When used:**
* Medical claims with life/safety implications
* Legal interpretations with significant impact
* Scientific claims with high controversy
* Technical claims requiring specialized knowledge

**Process:**
* Moderator identifies need for expert input
* Contact expert externally (don't require them to be users)
* Expert provides written opinion with sources
* Opinion may inform UCM config improvements (e.g., domain-specific prompt adjustments)

**Important**: This is CONSULTATION, not APPROVAL. Expert input may lead to UCM config improvements that benefit all future analyses in that domain.

**User Needs served**: UN-16 (Expert validation status)

== 2. Publication Modes ==

**Fulfills**: UN-1 (Trust indicators), UN-16 (Review status transparency)

FactHarbor uses **TWO publication modes** (not three). Focus is on transparency and confidence scoring, not gatekeeping.

=== 2.1 Mode 1: Draft-Only ===

**Status**: Not visible to public

**When Used:**
* Quality gates failed
* Confidence below threshold
* Structural integrity issues
* Insufficient evidence

**What Happens:**
* Content remains private
* System logs failure reasons
* Prompts/algorithms improved based on patterns
* Content may be re-processed after improvements

**NOT "pending human approval"** - it's blocked because it doesn't meet automated quality standards.

=== 2.2 Mode 2: AI-Generated (Public) ===

**Status**: Published and visible to all users

**When Used:**
* Quality gates passed
* Confidence ≥ threshold
* Meets structural requirements
* Sufficient evidence found

**Includes:**
* Confidence score displayed (0-100%)
* Risk tier badge (A/B/C)
* Quality indicators
* Clear "AI-Generated" labeling
* Sampling audit status

**Labels by Risk Tier:**
* **Tier A (High Risk):** "⚠️ AI-Generated - High Impact Topic - Seek Professional Advice"
* **Tier B (Medium Risk):** "🤖 AI-Generated - May Contain Errors"
* **Tier C (Low Risk):** "🤖 AI-Generated"

**System Improvement:**
* Quality improvements flow through UCM configuration changes
* All config changes versioned and auditable
* Every analysis references the UCM config snapshot used
* Sampling audits identify systematic issues for UCM config improvement

== 3. Content States ==

=== 3.1 Published ===

**Status**: Visible to all users

**Includes:**
* AI-generated analyses (default state after passing gates)

**Quality Indicators** (displayed with content):
* **Confidence Score**: 0-100% (AI's confidence in analysis)
* **Source Quality Score**: 0-100% (based on source track record)
* **Controversy Flag**: If high dispute among sources
* **Completeness Score**: % of expected fields filled
* **Analysis Date**: When the analysis was performed
* **UCM Config Version**: Which configuration version produced this analysis

**Automatic Warnings:**
* Confidence < 60%: "Low confidence - use caution"
* Source quality < 40%: "Sources may be unreliable"
* High controversy: "Disputed - multiple interpretations exist"
* Medical/Legal/Safety domain: "Seek professional advice"

**User Needs served**: UN-1 (Trust score), UN-9 (Methodology transparency), ~~UN-15 (Evolution timeline - Deferred)~~, UN-16 (Review status)

=== 3.2 Hidden ===

**Status**: Not visible to regular users (only to moderators)

**Reasons:**
* Spam or advertising
* Personal attacks or harassment
* Illegal content
* Privacy violations
* Deliberate misinformation (verified)
* Abuse or harmful content

**Process:**
* Automated detection flags for moderator review
* Moderator confirms and hides
* Original author notified with reason
* Can appeal to board if disputes moderator decision

**Note**: Content is hidden, not deleted (for audit trail)

== 4. Roles Overview ==

**Four roles:**

1. **Reader** (default, guest) – Anonymous visitors. Browse, search, view results. No registration required.
2. **User** (registered) – Logged-in users. Submit URLs/text for analysis (rate-limited), flag issues. Registration required.
3. **UCM Administrator** (appointed) – Manage system configuration to improve analysis quality. Appointed by Governing Team.
4. **Moderator** (appointed) – Handle abuse, spam, harassment. Does NOT manage content quality (that is automated).
5. **Domain Expert** (optional, task-specific) – Consulted externally for high-stakes disputes. Not a platform role.

**Key Principle**: Analysis output data is immutable. Quality improvements flow through UCM configuration changes, not data edits.

== 5. Principles ==

* **Improve the system, not the data** — analysis outputs are immutable
* **Low barrier to entry** — anyone can browse and search without registration; submission requires a free account
* **Clear separation** between content quality (automated) and behavioral moderation (human)
* **UCM-driven improvement** — quality improvements flow through configuration changes
* **No gatekeeping** for content publication
* **Every report references its config** — full reproducibility via UCM config snapshots
