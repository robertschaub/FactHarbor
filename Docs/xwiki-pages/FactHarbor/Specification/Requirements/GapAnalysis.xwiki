= Gap Analysis =

**Status:** ✅ Analysis Complete 
**Purpose:** Identify features NOT YET planned for releases up to V1.0

{{info}}
**Scope:** This analysis only includes gaps - features that are NOT addressed in existing requirements (FR1-FR54, NFR1-NFR13, UN-1 to UN-28) or planned future requirements.

**Already Planned for V1.0:** ClaimReview Schema (FR44) is NOT listed here as it's already planned for V1.0.

**Deferred to V1.5:** Image/Video Verification (FR46, FR51) and Archive.org (FR47) have been moved to V1.5, so they ARE included in this Gap Analysis.

**Requirement Numbers:** Proposed new requirements use numbers that avoid conflicts: FR55-FR84, NFR14-NFR18, UN-29 to UN-36

== 1. Analysis Framework ==

=== 1.1 Importance Formula ===

**Importance = f(risk, impact, strategy)**

* **Risk:** What are the consequences if we don't have this feature?
* **Impact:** How many users affected? How severe?
* **Strategy:** How well does this align with FactHarbor's mission and strategic goals?

**Importance Levels:**
* **VERY HIGH:** Critical to mission, high risk if missing, affects majority of users
* **HIGH:** Important for success, significant impact, strong strategic alignment
* **MEDIUM:** Valuable but not critical, moderate impact
* **LOW:** Nice-to-have, limited impact

=== 1.2 Urgency Formula ===

**Urgency = f(fail fast and learn, legal, promises made)**

* **Fail fast and learn:** Do we need to validate assumptions quickly?
* **Legal:** Are there legal requirements or external deadlines?
* **Promises made:** Have we committed this to stakeholders, funders, or partners?

**Urgency Levels:**
* **HIGH:** External deadlines, legal requirements, or critical testing needed
* **MEDIUM:** Strategic opportunity, growing trends, competitive pressure
* **LOW:** No external pressure, can add anytime

=== 1.3 Context Matters ===

**Important principle:** Importance and urgency change based on milestone context.

* **POC:** Only basic features urgent
* **Beta:** More features become urgent for user testing
* **Release:** Legal/compliance becomes critical

**Priorities are not absolute - they're contextual.**

 * Affects blind, low-vision, deaf, motor impairments, cognitive disabilities
 * "86% of companies report improved customer satisfaction after implementing accessibility" (Forrester)
* **Strategy:** CRITICAL ALIGNMENT
 * Mission is "a world where decisions are grounded in evidence" - not "for sighted people only"
 * Non-profit public interest mission requires serving ALL publics

**Why Urgent:**
* **Fail fast:** HIGH - Legal deadlines approaching (EU Accessibility Act June 2025)
* **Legal:** CRITICAL - Required by law in EU, Canada, US (Section 508, ADA)

**When to Address:** Build in from MVP/POC1 - retrofitting is 100x more expensive

**Research Evidence:**
* "1 in 4 adults in the US has a disability" (CDC 2023)
* "Legal actions increased 14% in 2023" (Forrester accessibility report)
* European Accessibility Act mandatory June 28, 2025
