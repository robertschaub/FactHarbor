= POC1: Core Workflow with Quality Gates =

**Phase Goal:** Prove AKEL can produce credible, quality outputs without manual intervention

**Success Metric:** <10% hallucination rate, quality gates prevent low-confidence publications

== 1. Overview ==

POC1 validates that the core AKEL workflow (Article → Claims → Verdicts) can produce trustworthy fact-checking analyses automatically. This phase implements **2 critical quality gates** to prevent low-quality outputs from being published.

**Key Innovation:** Quality validation BEFORE publication, not after

**What We're Proving:**

* AKEL can reliably extract factual claims from articles
* AKEL can generate credible verdicts with proper evidence
* **AKEL can assess article credibility beyond simple claim averaging** (context-aware analysis)
* Quality gates prevent hallucinations and low-confidence outputs
* Fully automated approach is viable

== 2. Scope ==

=== In Scope ===

* Core AKEL workflow (claim extraction, verdict generation)
* **Gate 1:** Claim Validation (factual vs. opinion/prediction)
* **Gate 4:** Verdict Confidence Assessment (minimum 2 sources, quality thresholds)
* Basic UI to display results
* Manual quality tracking

=== Out of Scope (Deferred to POC2+) ===

* User accounts / authentication
* Corrections system
* Search engine optimization (ClaimReview schema)
* Image verification
* API endpoints
* Archive.org integration
* Security hardening
* A/B testing
* Gates 2 & 3 (Evidence relevance, Scenario coherence)

=== Experimental Features (POC1) ===

**Context-Aware Analysis** (Approach 1: Single-Pass Holistic)

**Goal:** Test if AI can detect when an article's overall credibility differs from the average of its claim verdicts (e.g., accurate facts but misleading conclusion).

**Implementation:**
* Enhanced AI prompt to evaluate logical structure
* AI identifies article's main argument
* AI assesses if conclusion follows from evidence
* Article verdict may differ from claim average

**Testing:**
* 30-article test set (10 straightforward, 10 misleading, 10 complex)
* Success criteria: ≥70% accuracy on misleading articles
* Marked as experimental - doesn't block POC1 success

**See:** [[Article Verdict Problem>>FactHarbor.Specification.POC.Article-Verdict-Problem]] for complete analysis

**Decision:** 
* If ≥70% accuracy → ship in POC2
* If 50-70% → try weighted aggregation approach
* If <50% → defer to POC2 with different approach

== 3. Requirements ==

=== 3.1 NFR11: Quality Assurance Framework (POC1 Lite Version) ===

**Importance:** CRITICAL - Core POC1 Requirement 
**Fulfills:** AI safety, credibility, prevents embarrassing failures

**Specification:**

AKEL must validate outputs before displaying to users. POC1 implements a **2-gate subset** of the full NFR11 framework.

==== Gate 1: Claim Validation ====

**Purpose:** Ensure extracted claims are factual assertions, not opinions or predictions

**Validation Checks:**

1. **Factual Statement Test:** Can this be verified with evidence?
2. **Opinion Detection:** Contains hedging language? ("I think", "probably", "best", "worst")
3. **Specificity Score:** Contains concrete details? (names, numbers, dates, locations)
4. **Future Prediction Test:** Makes claims about future events?

**Pass Criteria:**
{{code}}- isFactual: true
- opinionScore: ≤ 0.3
- specificityScore: ≥ 0.3
- claimType: FACTUAL{{/code}}

**Action if Failed:**

* Flag as "Non-verifiable: Opinion/Prediction/Ambiguous"
* Do NOT generate scenarios or verdicts
* Display explanation to user

**Target:** 0% opinion statements processed as facts

==== Gate 4: Verdict Confidence Assessment ====

**Purpose:** Only publish verdicts with sufficient evidence and confidence

**Validation Checks:**

1. **Evidence Count:** Minimum 2 independent sources
2. **Source Quality:** Average reliability ≥ 0.6 (on 0-1 scale)
3. **Evidence Agreement:** % supporting vs. contradicting ≥ 0.6
4. **Uncertainty Factors:** Count of hedging statements in reasoning

**Confidence Tiers:**
{{code}}HIGH (80-100%):
 - ≥3 sources
 - ≥0.7 average quality
 - ≥80% agreement
 
MEDIUM (50-79%):
 - ≥2 sources
 - ≥0.6 average quality
 - ≥60% agreement
 
LOW (0-49%):
 - ≥2 sources BUT low quality/agreement
 
INSUFFICIENT:
 - <2 sources → DO NOT PUBLISH{{/code}}

**POC1 Publication Rule:**

* Minimum **MEDIUM** confidence required
* Blocked verdicts show "Insufficient Evidence" message

**Target:** 0% verdicts published with <2 sources

=== 3.2 Modified FR7: Automated Verdicts (Enhanced) ===

**Enhancement for POC1:**

After AKEL generates a verdict, it must pass through the quality validation pipeline:

{{code}}
AKEL Workflow (POC1):

1. Extract claims from article
 ↓
2. [GATE 1] Validate each claim is fact-checkable
 ↓ (pass claims only)
3. Generate verdicts for each claim
 ↓
4. [GATE 4] Validate verdict has sufficient evidence
 ↓ (pass verdicts only)
5. Display to user

Failed claims/verdicts:
- Store in database with failure reason
- Display explanatory message to user
- Log for quality metrics tracking
{{/code}}

**Updated Verdict States:**

* PUBLISHED - Passed all gates
* INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE - Failed Gate 4
* NON_FACTUAL_CLAIM - Failed Gate 1
* PROCESSING - In progress
* ERROR - System failure

=== 3.3 Modified FR4: Analysis Summary (Enhanced) ===

**Enhancement for POC1:**

Analysis Summary must now display quality metadata:

{{code}}
Analysis Summary:
 Total Claims Found: 5
 Verifiable Claims: 3
 Non-verifiable (Opinion): 1
 Non-verifiable (Prediction): 1
 
 Verdicts Generated: 3
 High Confidence: 1
 Medium Confidence: 2
 Insufficient Evidence: 0
 
 Evidence Sources: 12 total
 Average Source Quality: 0.73
 
 Quality Score: 8.5/10
{{/code}}

== 4. Success Criteria ==

POC1 is considered **SUCCESSFUL** if:

**✅ Functional:**

* Processes diverse test articles without crashes
* Generates verdicts for all factual claims
* Blocks all non-factual claims (0% pass through)
* Blocks all insufficient-evidence verdicts (0% with <2 sources)

**✅ Quality:**

* Hallucination rate <10% (manual verification)
* 0 verdicts with <2 sources published
* 0 opinion statements published as facts
* Average quality score ≥7.0/10

**✅ Performance:**

* Processing time reasonable for POC demonstration
* Quality gates execute efficiently
* UI displays results clearly

**✅ Learnings:**

* Identified prompt engineering improvements
* Documented AKEL strengths/weaknesses
* Validated threshold values
* Clear path to POC2 defined

== 5. Decision Gates ==

**POC1 → POC2 Decision:**

* **IF** hallucination rate >10% → Pause, improve prompts before POC2
* **IF** majority of claims non-processable → Rethink claim extraction approach
* **IF** quality gates too strict (excessive blocking) → Adjust thresholds
* **IF** quality gates too loose (hallucinations pass) → Tighten criteria

**Only proceed to POC2 if all success criteria met**

== 6. Architecture Notes ==

**POC1 Simplified Architecture:**

{{code}}
User Input → AKEL Processing → Quality Gates → Display
 (claim extraction (Gates 1 & 4)
 + verdicts)
{{/code}}

**vs. Full System (Future):**

{{code}}
Input → Claim Extractor → Scenario Generator → Evidence Linker 
→ Verdict Generator → All 4 Gates → Review Queue → Publication
{{/code}}

**POC1 Acceptable Simplifications:**

* Single AKEL call (not multi-component pipeline)
* No scenarios (implicit in verdicts)
* Basic evidence linking
* 2 gates instead of 4
* No review queue
