**Claim**: "Bolsonaro's trials were fair and based on Brazilian law"

----

=== Two Separate Proceedings Analyzed ===

|=Proceeding|=Court|=Year|=Charge|=Outcome
|Electoral Ineligibility|TSE|2023|Abuse of power, media misuse|8-year ban (5-2 vote)
|Criminal Conviction|STF|2025|Attempted coup, criminal organization|27 years prison (4-1 vote)

----

=== Verdicts ===

|=Dimension|=Verdict|=Confidence
|**Legal Basis**|STRONGLY SUPPORTED|85%
|**Procedural Fairness**|LARGELY SUPPORTED with caveats|70%

----

=== Key Findings ===

**✅ Supporting Fairness:**

* Clear legal framework (Electoral Code, Criminal Code Title XII)
* Law 14.197/2021 used for prosecution was enacted //under Bolsonaro's own presidency//
* Extensive evidence (884-page police report, 73 witnesses, coup decree drafts found)
* Full defense presented, public trial, right to appeal granted
* Multiple judges reviewed evidence (not single-judge decision)

**⚠️ Legitimate Concerns:**

* Justice Alexandre de Moraes was a //target of the assassination plot// yet presided (appearance of bias)
* 27-year sentence is very heavy by international standards
* Political polarization complicates neutral perception
* US pressure (50% tariffs, sanctions on judges) creates diplomatic complications
* Timing during Lula presidency raises perception issues

=== International Expert Assessment ===

|=Source|=Position
|Harvard Prof. Steven Levitsky|"Milestone of institutional resilience"
|The Economist|"Solidity of Brazil's judiciary"
|NY City Bar Association|Condemned US pressure, affirmed judicial independence
|Folha de S. Paulo (Brazilian liberal paper)|"**Fair conviction, high punishment**"
|Trump Administration|Called it "witch hunt"

----

=== Balanced Conclusion ===

**Both statements can be simultaneously true:**

1. The trials followed established Brazilian law with extensive evidence
1. There are legitimate concerns about perception of judicial neutrality and sentence severity
