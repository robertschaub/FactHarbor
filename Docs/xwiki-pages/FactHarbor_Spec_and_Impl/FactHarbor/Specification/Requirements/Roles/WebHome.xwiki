= Roles & Publication Modes =

**Version:** 0.9.70 
**Last Updated:** December 21, 2025 
**Status:** CORRECTED - Automation Philosophy Consistent

This page defines user roles and publication modes in FactHarbor.

== 1. User Roles ==

=== 1.1 Contributors ===

**Who**: Community members who suggest system improvements

**Responsibilities:**
* Participate in sampling audits (analyze patterns, not individual outputs)
* Suggest algorithm/prompt improvements based on findings
* Document systematic issues observed
* Contribute to system improvement discussions

**Can:**
* Edit published content (changes apply immediately, Wikipedia-style)
* Flag quality issues (for sampling audit)
* Earn reputation through contributions
* Participate in RFC (Request for Comments) processes

**Cannot:**
* Approve content before publication
* Override quality gates
* Act as gatekeepers
* Manually fix individual AI outputs

**Note**: Contributors improve THE SYSTEM, not individual outputs.

=== 1.2 Trusted Contributors ===

**Who**: Contributors with proven track record and domain expertise

**Responsibilities:**
* Same as Contributors, plus:
* Review complex algorithm changes
* Provide domain expertise on contested claims
* Mentor new contributors

**Can:**
* Everything Contributors can do, plus:
* Participate in higher-level system design decisions
* Review RFC proposals
* Access more detailed system metrics

**Cannot:**
* Approve content before publication
* Override quality gates
* Act as gatekeepers

**Important**: "Trusted" refers to judgment quality, NOT approval authority.

=== 1.3 Moderators ===

**Who**: Team members focused on community health and abuse prevention

**Responsibilities:**
* Handle abuse, spam, and harassment
* Enforce community guidelines
* Respond to user reports
* Manage bans and appeals

**Can:**
* Hide abusive content
* Ban users for policy violations
* Review appeals
* Escalate serious issues to Governing Team

**Cannot:**
* Approve content for publication
* Review content quality before publication
* Override quality gates for content
* Act as editorial gatekeepers

**Critical Distinction:**
{{{
Moderators handle: ABUSE (spam, harassment, violations)
Moderators DO NOT handle: CONTENT QUALITY (that's automated)
}}}

=== 1.4 Domain Trusted Contributors (Optional, Task-Specific) ===

**Who**: Subject matter specialists invited for specific high-stakes disputes

**Not a permanent role**: Contacted externally when needed for contested claims in their domain

**When used:**
* Medical claims with life/safety implications
* Legal interpretations with significant impact
* Scientific claims with high controversy
* Technical claims requiring specialized knowledge

**Process:**
* Moderator identifies need for expert input
* Contact expert externally (don't require them to be users)
* Trusted Contributor provides written opinion with sources
* Opinion added to claim record
* Trusted Contributor acknowledged in claim

**Important**: This is CONSULTATION, not APPROVAL. Their opinion is added to the evidence, not used as a gate.

**User Needs served**: UN-16 (Expert validation status)

== 2. Publication Modes ==

**Fulfills**: UN-1 (Trust indicators), UN-16 (Review status transparency)

FactHarbor uses **TWO publication modes** (not three). Focus is on transparency and confidence scoring, not gatekeeping.

=== 2.1 Mode 1: Draft-Only ===

**Status**: Not visible to public

**When Used:**
* Quality gates failed
* Confidence below threshold
* Structural integrity issues
* Insufficient evidence

**What Happens:**
* Content remains private
* System logs failure reasons
* Prompts/algorithms improved based on patterns
* Content may be re-processed after improvements

**NOT "pending human approval"** - it's blocked because it doesn't meet automated quality standards.

=== 2.2 Mode 2: AI-Generated (Public) ===

**Status**: Published and visible to all users

**When Used:**
* Quality gates passed
* Confidence ≥ threshold
* Meets structural requirements
* Sufficient evidence found

**Includes:**
* Confidence score displayed (0-100%)
* Risk tier badge (A/B/C)
* Quality indicators
* Clear "AI-Generated" labeling
* Sampling audit status

**Labels by Risk Tier:**
* **Tier A (High Risk):** "⚠️ AI-Generated - High Impact Topic - Seek Professional Advice"
* **Tier B (Medium Risk):** "🤖 AI-Generated - May Contain Errors"
* **Tier C (Low Risk):** "🤖 AI-Generated"

**User Contributions:**
* User edits apply immediately (Wikipedia model)
* All changes logged and versioned
* May be selected for sampling audit
* Reputation earned for quality contributions

=== REMOVED: Mode 3 ===

**V0.9.50 Decision:** No centralized approval workflow.

**Rationale:**
* Defeats automation purpose
* Creates bottleneck
* Inconsistent quality
* Not scalable

**What Replaced It:**
* Better quality gates
* Sampling audits for system improvement
* Transparent confidence scoring
* Risk-based warnings

== 3. Content States ==

=== 3.1 Published ===

**Status**: Visible to all users

**Includes:**
* AI-generated analyses (default state after passing gates)
* User-contributed content
* Edited/improved content

**Quality Indicators** (displayed with content):
* **Confidence Score**: 0-100% (AI's confidence in analysis)
* **Source Quality Score**: 0-100% (based on source track record)
* **Controversy Flag**: If high dispute/edit activity
* **Completeness Score**: % of expected fields filled
* **Last Updated**: Date of most recent change
* **Edit Count**: Number of revisions
* **Review Status**: AI-generated / Enhanced by contributors

**Automatic Warnings:**
* Confidence < 60%: "Low confidence - use caution"
* Source quality < 40%: "Sources may be unreliable"
* High controversy: "Disputed - multiple interpretations exist"
* Medical/Legal/Safety domain: "Seek professional advice"

**User Needs served**: UN-1 (Trust score), UN-9 (Methodology transparency), ~~UN-15 (Evolution timeline - Deferred)~~, UN-16 (Review status)

=== 3.2 Hidden ===

**Status**: Not visible to regular users (only to moderators)

**Reasons:**
* Spam or advertising
* Personal attacks or harassment
* Illegal content
* Privacy violations
* Deliberate misinformation (verified)
* Abuse or harmful content

**Process:**
* Automated detection flags for moderator review
* Moderator confirms and hides
* Original author notified with reason
* Can appeal to board if disputes moderator decision

**Note**: Content is hidden, not deleted (for audit trail)

== 4. Role Evolution Path ==

**Contributor Journey:**

1. **Visitor** – Explores platform, reads documentation, may raise questions
2. **New Contributor** – Submits first improvements (typo fixes, small clarifications, new issues)
3. **Contributor** – Contributes regularly and follows project conventions
4. **Trusted Contributor** – Has a track record of high-quality work and reliable judgment
5. **Auditor** – Participates in sampling audits (pattern analysis)
6. **Moderator** – Focuses on behavior, tone, and conflict moderation (not content quality)
7. **Domain Expert** (optional) – Offers domain expertise without changing governance authority

**Key Principle**: Low barrier to entry, transparent criteria for advancement, clear separation between content quality (automated) and behavior moderation (human).

== 5. Principles ==

* **Low barrier to entry** for new contributors
* **Transparent criteria** for gaining and losing responsibilities
* **Clear separation** between content quality (automated) and behavioral moderation (human)
* **Documented processes** for escalation and appeal
* **No gatekeeping** for content publication
* **Immediate application** of contributions (Wikipedia model)
