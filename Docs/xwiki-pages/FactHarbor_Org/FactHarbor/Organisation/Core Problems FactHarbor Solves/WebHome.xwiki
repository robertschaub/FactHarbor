**Our Mission**
FactHarbor brings clarity and transparency to a world full of unclear, contested, and misleading information by shedding light on the context, assumptions, and evidence behind claims.
)))
== 1. Core Problems ==
=== 1.1 Problem 1 — Misinformation & Manipulation ===
Falsehoods and distortions spread rapidly through:
* Political propaganda
* Social media amplification
* Coordinated influence networks
* AI-generated fake content
Users need a structured system that resists manipulation and makes reasoning transparent.
=== 1.2 Problem 2 — Missing Context Behind Claims ===
Most claims change meaning drastically depending on:
* Definitions
* Assumptions
* Boundaries
* Interpretation
FactHarbor reveals and compares these variations.
=== 1.3 Problem 3 — "Binary Fact Checks" Fail ===
Most fact-checking simplifies complex claims into:
* True
* Mostly True
* False
This hides legitimate contextual differences.
FactHarbor replaces binary judgment with scenario-based, likelihood-driven evaluation.
=== 1.4 Problem 4 — Good Evidence Is Hard to Find ===
High-quality evidence exists — but users often cannot:
* Locate it
* Assess its reliability
* Understand how it fits into a scenario
* Compare it with competing evidence
FactHarbor aggregates, assesses, and organizes evidence with full transparency.
=== 1.5 Problem 5 — Claims Evolve Over Time ===
Research and understanding change:
* New studies emerge
* Old studies are retracted
* Consensus shifts
FactHarbor provides:
* Full entity versioning
* Verdict timelines
* Automatic re-evaluation when inputs change
=== 1.6 Problem 6 — Users Cannot See Why People Disagree ===
People often assume others are ignorant or dishonest, when disagreements typically arise from:
* Different definitions
* Different implicit assumptions
* Different evidence
* Different contexts
FactHarbor exposes these underlying structures so disagreements become understandable, not divisive.
== 2. Core Concepts ==
=== 2.1 Claim ===
A user- or AI-submitted statement whose meaning is often ambiguous and requires structured interpretation.
A claim does not receive a single verdict — it branches into scenarios that clarify its meaning.
=== 2.2 Scenario ===
A structured interpretation that clarifies what the claim means under a specific set of:
* Boundaries
* Definitions
* Assumptions
* Contextual conditions
Multiple scenarios allow claims to be understood fairly and without political or ideological bias.
=== 2.3 Evidence ===
Information that supports or contradicts a scenario.
Evidence includes empirical studies, experimental data, expert consensus, historical records, contextual background, and absence-of-evidence signals.
Evidence evolves through versioning and includes reliability assessment.
=== 2.4 Verdict ===
A likelihood estimate for a claim within a specific scenario based on evidence quality, quantity, methodology, uncertainty factors, and comparison with competing scenarios.
Each verdict is versioned and includes a historical timeline.
=== 2.5 AI Knowledge Extraction Layer (AKEL) ===
The AI subsystem that interprets claims, proposes scenario drafts, retrieves evidence, classifies sources, drafts verdicts, detects contradictions, and triggers re-evaluation when inputs change.
AKEL outputs follow risk-based publication model with quality gates and audit oversight.
=== 2.6 Decentralized Federation Model ===
FactHarbor supports a decentralized, multi-node architecture where each node stores its own data and synchronizes via federation protocol.
This increases resilience, autonomy, and scalability.
== 3. Vision for Impact ==
FactHarbor aims to:
* **Reduce polarization** by revealing legitimate grounds for disagreement
* **Combat misinformation** by providing structured, transparent evaluation
* **Empower users** to make informed judgments based on evidence
* **Support deliberative democracy** by clarifying complex policy questions
* **Enable federated knowledge** so no single entity controls the truth
* **Resist manipulation** through transparent reasoning and quality oversight
* **Evolve with research** by continuously improving analysis through UCM configuration
