= Decision Processes =
== 1. Overview ==
This page describes the main types of decisions in FactHarbor and how they are escalated and documented.
== 2. Types of Decisions ==
* **Operational decisions** – day-to-day actions within an agreed budget or scope.
* **Strategic decisions** – long-term direction, major priorities, and partnerships.
* **Governance decisions** – changes to rules, roles, and organisational structures.
* **Exceptional decisions** – sensitive topics, serious conflicts, or rule violations.
== 2.5 Automation Boundary ==
**Critical distinction**: What AKEL decides vs. what humans decide.
=== 2.5.1 Automated Decisions (AKEL) ===
**All content decisions are automated**:
* ✅ Claim verdicts and confidence scores
* ✅ Evidence assessment and relevance scoring
* ✅ Source track record scoring
* ✅ Risk tier classification
* ✅ Scenario extraction
* ✅ Publication decisions
* ✅ Contradiction detection
**Why automated?**
* Scale: Cannot manually process millions of claims
* Consistency: Algorithms apply rules uniformly
* Transparency: Code can be audited
* No bias: No human subjective judgment
* 24/7: Always available
**Human role**: Monitor aggregate metrics, identify systematic issues, improve algorithms.
=== 2.5.2 Human Decisions ===
**System decisions (not content)**:
**Strategic** (General Assembly, 2/3 majority):
* Mission and values changes
* Risk tier policy definitions
* Major architectural changes
* Budget allocation >CHF 50,000
* Organizational structure
* Dissolution
**Tactical** (Governing Team, consent-based):
* Algorithm parameter adjustments (within policy)
* Policy updates and clarifications
* Infrastructure investments
* Hiring and role assignments
* Partnership agreements
* Community guidelines
**Operational** (Domain owners, autonomous):
* Technical Coordinator: AKEL optimizations, infrastructure changes
* Community Coordinator: Process improvements, documentation
* Moderators: Handling AKEL-flagged items
**Emergency** (Any team member, ratified later):
* Critical security vulnerabilities
* Legal compliance requirements
* Immediate safety threats
=== 2.5.3 Principle: Fix the System, Not the Data ===
**When AKEL makes what appears to be a wrong decision**:
❌ **Don't do this**:
* Manually override that specific verdict
* Adjust that source's score manually
* Create special case for that claim
✅ **Do this instead**:
1. Investigate: Is this a systematic issue?
2. Analyze: What pattern caused this?
3. Improve: Change algorithm/policy systematically
4. Test: Validate on historical data
5. Deploy: Roll out improved system
6. Monitor: Check if metrics improve
**Example**:
* ❌ Bad: "AKEL rated this credible source too low. I'll manually boost it from 0.6 to 0.8."
* ✅ Good: "AKEL consistently under-rates peer-reviewed medical journals. Let's adjust the scoring algorithm to weight peer-review certification +15% for medical sources. Test on 1000 historical claims first."
== 3. Principles ==
* Decide at the lowest reasonable level.
* Involve the people who are affected.
* Record context, reasoning, and outcome for significant decisions.
* Keep escalation paths clear and predictable.
=== 3.5 Decision Methods ===
Different types of decisions use different methods:
**Consent-Based Decision Making** (from Sociocracy 3.0):
* **Use for**: Algorithm changes, policy updates, process changes, role assignments
* **Process**: Proposal → Questions → Reactions → Amend → Consent round
* **Criteria**: No principled objections (not consensus)
* **See**: [[Consent-Based Decision Making>>FactHarbor.Organisation.How-We-Work-Together.Consent-Based-Decision-Making]]
**Voting**:
* **Use for**: Strategic decisions, when consent fails
* **General Assembly**: 2/3 majority for major decisions
* **Governing Team**: Simple majority for tactical decisions
* **Emergency**: Simple majority, ratified later
**Autonomous**:
* **Use for**: Decisions within defined domain boundaries
* **Technical Coordinator**: Technical changes within domain
* **Community Coordinator**: Community process changes
* **Moderators**: Handling flagged items
* **Accountability**: Document decision, report to Governing Team quarterly
**RFC Process** (for technical/policy proposals):
* **Use for**: Significant system changes
* **Process**: 
 1. Create RFC (Request for Comments)
 2. Community discussion (7-appropriate time period)
 3. Revise based on feedback
 4. Decision by appropriate authority (consent or voting)
 5. Document and implement
== 4. Escalation Paths ==
Examples (to be adapted as the organisation grows):
* Content and modelling issues – Contributor → Contributor → Organisation Lead → Executive Lead → Governing Team.
* Behaviour and moderation issues – Moderator → Governance Steward → Executive Lead → Governing Team.
* Finance and compliance issues – Finance & Compliance Lead → Governance Steward → Governing Team.
== 5. Documentation ==
For significant decisions, at minimum record:
* date and time
* people involved and responsible role/body
* options considered
* reasoning and trade-offs
* final decision and expected impact
* follow-up actions and deadlines.
=== 5.1 Decision Record Template ===
For formal decisions, use the following template:
**Decision Record: [Title/Topic]**
* **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
* **Decider(s):** [Names/Roles]
* **Context:** [What is the issue? What constraints exist?]
* **Options Considered:**
 * Option A: ...
 * Option B: ...
* **Decision:** [The chosen path]
* **Reasoning:** [Why this option? Trade-offs accepted?]
* **Consequences:** [Expected impact, risks, follow-up tasks]
== 6. Integration with Tools ==
Over time, decision logs may be maintained in dedicated tools (e.g. XWiki pages, issue trackers, or lightweight registers.
Whatever the tool, Governance must be able to reconstruct how important decisions were made.
