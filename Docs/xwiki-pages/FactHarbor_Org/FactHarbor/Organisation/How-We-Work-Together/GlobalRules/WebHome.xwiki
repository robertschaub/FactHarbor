= Global Rules =
**Last Updated:** December 17, 2025 
These rules apply to all FactHarbor users, content, and processes.
**FactHarbor's Role:** Collect, aggregate, and summarize information that already exists. FactHarbor does not create original information or conduct investigations.
== 1. Core Principles ==
=== 1.1 Seek Truth ===
* Truth is the primary goal
* Evaluate existing information fairly
* Weight evidence by quality, not preference
* Update understanding as evidence changes
* Acknowledge uncertainty clearly
=== 1.2 Act Independently ===
* Free from obligation to any interest except truth
* Commercial interests in claim outcomes are disqualifying
* Disclose conflicts that might bias evaluation
* Independence from funders and sponsors
=== 1.3 Be Accountable and Transparent ===
**Strive to:**
* Make reasoning traceable where feasible
* Cite sources whenever possible
* Disclose conflicts of interest
* Mark AI involvement
* Correct mistakes promptly when discovered
* Explain decisions when challenged
**Goal:** Maximum transparency within practical constraints. Perfect traceability may not always be achievable, but the commitment to transparency remains.
=== 1.4 Intellectual Humility ===
* Acknowledge uncertainty
* Correct mistakes promptly
* Respect expertise but verify - anyone/any source could be wrong, biased, or dishonest
* Welcome disagreement
* Seek consensus, don't force it
== 2. Source Evaluation ==
=== 2.1 Source Evaluation Criteria ===
**Sources are evaluated by track record, not credentials.**
**Evaluation Factors:**
* **Accuracy history:** Has the source been reliable in the past?
* **Correction policy:** Do they promptly correct errors?
* **Methodology transparency:** Do they show their work?
* **Independence:** Are they free from controlling interests?
* **Trusted Contributorise:** Do they have relevant knowledge?
* **Consistency:** Do multiple independent sources agree?
**Track Record Over Title:**
✅ Government statistics from agencies with documented accuracy (Swiss Federal Statistical Office, etc.)
✅ Peer-reviewed research from journals with strong retraction/correction practices
✅ Journalism from outlets with fact-checking and correction policies
**Red Flags:**
* Consistent refusal to correct proven errors
* Conflicts of interest not disclosed
* Methodology hidden or vague
* Single-source claims without verification
* History of misinformation
* Authoritarian control (government sources)
**Principle:** Evaluate each source's track record individually. No type of source is automatically trustworthy.
=== 2.2 Multiple Sources ===
* Use multiple independent sources when possible
* Cross-reference claims
* Note when only single source available
* Prefer primary sources over secondary
=== 2.3 Source Attribution ===
* Always cite sources clearly
* Link to original when online
* Include author, publication, date
* Archive links for unstable URLs
== 3. Neutrality in Summarization ==
=== 3.1 Neutral Language ===
**Descriptive, not prescriptive:**
* ✅ "Policy reduced emissions by 15%"
**Balanced presentation:**
* Show competing views proportional to evidence
* Don't hide inconvenient evidence
* Weight by quality, not just quantity
**Precise, not loaded (in FactHarbor summaries):**
* ✅ "Protesters" 
**Note:** Source materials may contain loaded language. Quote exactly when citing sources, but use neutral language in FactHarbor's own summaries and analysis.
=== 3.2 No Cherry-Picking ===
* Present full picture
* Include contrary evidence
* Show trends, not just selected points
* Acknowledge limitations
=== 3.3 Context Matters ===
* Provide historical context
* Show comparisons
* Explain significance
* Present expert perspective
=== 3.4 Statistical Literacy ===
* Distinguish absolute vs percentage
* Show baselines and comparisons
* Note confidence intervals
* Distinguish correlation from causation
== 4. Accuracy and Corrections ==
=== 4.1 Accuracy Standards ===
* Verify facts before using
* Check spelling, dates, numbers
* Confirm quotes and attribution
* Cross-check details
=== 4.2 Corrections ===
Correct errors promptly and prominently:
```
CORRECTION: [Date] - [What was wrong and correction]
```
=== 4.3 Updates ===
When new information emerges:
```
UPDATE: [Date] - [New information]
```
== 5. Conflicts of Interest ==
=== 5.1 Commercial Interests Prohibited ===
Contributors with direct commercial interests in claim outcomes cannot contribute to those claims.
**Disqualifying:**
* Paid to promote/attack claim
* Stock/investment affected by verdict
* Employment contingent on outcome
* Consulting fees tied to position
=== 5.2 Other Conflicts - Disclosure Required ===
Disclose:
* Personal relationships to subjects
* Professional stake in conclusion
* Prior public positions on exact claim
* Ideological commitments affecting judgment
Format:
```
COI: [Clear description]
```
=== 5.3 When to Recuse ===
* Direct commercial interest (always)
* Cannot evaluate objectively
* Appearance of bias would harm credibility
