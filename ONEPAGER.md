# FactHarbor

## Vision

A world where decisions and public debate are grounded in evidence, so people can move forward with clarity and confidence.

## Purpose

FactHarbor exists to help people make sense of complex, contested information without stripping away nuance. In a world where misleading content spreads fast and oversimplified verdicts breed distrust, we provide a transparent path from confusion to understanding.

## Mission

FactHarbor brings clarity and transparency to a world full of unclear, contested, and misleading information by shedding light on the context, assumptions, and evidence behind claims.

## Why?

Complex topics—climate policy, health research, economic forecasts, technology risks—don't fit into simple "true" or "false" boxes. Yet that's how most information gets presented.

The result: people either accept conclusions on blind faith or dismiss them entirely. Neither leads to good decisions. What's missing is transparent reasoning—the ability to see not just *what* someone concluded, but *how* they got there and *what assumptions* they made along the way.

FactHarbor fills that gap. We believe trust comes not from authority, but from a process anyone can inspect.

## What?

FactHarbor is an open-source nonprofit project that transforms complex, contested articles into **Evidence Models**—structured breakdowns that make reasoning visible and verifiable.

An Evidence Model contains:

- **Claims** — The key assertions extracted from the source material
- **Scenarios** — The contexts and conditions under which claims may hold true or false
- **Evidence** — Supporting and opposing sources linked to specific claims and scenarios
- **Verdicts** — Conclusions with explicit confidence levels and stated assumptions
- **Context** — Background information, definitions, and scope made transparent

The result is not a single verdict, but a **truth landscape**—showing where a claim holds up, where it fails, and where reasonable disagreement exists.

## How?

FactHarbor combines structured methodology with AI assistance and human oversight:

1. **Submission** — A user submits an article URL or text for analysis
2. **Claim Extraction** — Key claims are identified and grouped into clusters
3. **Scenario Building** — Relevant contexts and assumptions are defined
4. **Evidence Gathering** — Supporting and opposing evidence is retrieved and linked
5. **Verdict Formation** — Conclusions are drafted with explicit confidence scores
6. **Quality Validation** — Mandatory checks ensure contradictory evidence was considered
7. **Publication** — The Evidence Model is published for exploration and reuse
